<h3>William Morris</h3>

<h2>UNJUST WAR</h2>

<h3>TO THE WORKING-MEN OF ENGLAND.</h3> 

<blockquote>
<p>"Friends and fellow-citizens:- there is danger of war; bestir yourselves
to face that danger. If you go to sleep, saying we do not understand it,
and the danger is far away you may wake and find the evil fallen upon
you, for even now it is at the door. Take heed in time and consider
it well, for a hard matter it will be for most of us to bear war taxes,
war prices, war losses of wealth and work, and friends and kindred; we
shall pay heavily, and you, friends of the working classes, will pay
the heaviest.</p>

<p>And what shall we buy at this heavy price? Will it be glory and wealth
and peace for those that come after us?</p>

<p>Alas! no; for those are the gains of a <em>just</em> war; but, if we wage
the <em>unjust</em> war that fools and cowards are bidding us wage to-day,
our loss of work will buy us loss of hope, our loss of friends and kindred
will buy us enemies from father to son.</p> 

<p>"An unjust war!" I say: for do not be deceived; if we go to war with
Russia now, it will not be to punish her for evil deeds done, or to hinder
her from evil deeds hereafter, but to put down just insurrection against the
thieves and murderers of Turkey; to stir up a faint pleasure in the hearts
of the no-nothing fools that cry out without meaning for a "spirited foreign
policy," to guard our well-beloved rule in India from the coward fear of an
invasion that may happen a hundred years hence - or never; to exhibit our
army and navy once more before the wondering Eyes of Europe; to give a
little hope to our holders of Turkish bonds:- Working-men of England, which
of these things do you think worth starving for, worth dying for? Do all of
them rallied into one make that body of ENGLISH INTERESTS we have heard of
lately?</p>

<p>And who are they who flaunt in our faces the banner
inscribed on one side "ENGLISH INTERESTS," and on the other "RUSSIAN
MISDEEDS?" Who are they that are leading us into war? Let us look at
these saviours of England's honour, these champions of Poland, these
scourgers of Russia's iniquities! Do you know them? Greedy gamblers on
the Stock Exchange, idle officers of the army and navy (poor fellows!),
worn-out mockers of the clubs, desperate purveyors of exciting war
news for the comfortable breakfast tables of those who have nothing
to lose by war; and lastly, in the place of honour, the Tory Rump, that
we fools, weary of peace, reason, and justice, chose at the last 
election to represent us; and above all their captain, the ancient
place-hunter, who, having at last climbed into an earl's chair, grins
down thence into the anxious face of England, while his empty heart and
shifty head is compassing the stroke that will bring on - our destruction 
perhaps, our confusion certainly. O shame and double shame if we march
under such leadership as this in an UNJUST WAR against a people who are
NOT our enemies, against Europe, against freedom, against nature,
against the hope of the world.</p>

<p> Working men of England, one word of warning yet. I doubt if you know the
bitterness of hatred against freedom and progress that lies at the hearts of
a certain part of the richer classes in this country; their newspapers veil
it in a kind of decent language, but if you were to hear them talking among
themselves, as I have done, I know not whether scorn or anger would prevail
in you at their folly and insolence. These men cannot speak of your order,
of its aims, of its leaders, without a sneer or an insult. These men, if
they had the power (may England perish rather!) would thwart your just
aspirations, would silence you, would deliver you bound hand and foot for
ever to irresponsible capital. And these men, I say it deliberately, are the
heart and soul of the party that is driving us to an UNJUST WAR. They can
harm us but little now; but if war comes, UNJUST WAR, with all its confusion
and anger, who shall say what their power may be, what step backward we may
make. Fellow-citizens, look to it, and if you have any wrongs to be
redressed, if you long to lessen those inequalities whihc have been our
stumbling block since the beginning of the world, then cast aside sloth, and
cry out against an UNJUST WAR, and urge us of the Middle Classes to do no
less, so that we may all protest solemnly and perseveringly against out
being dragged (and who knows for why?) into an UNJUST WAR, in which, if we
are victorious, we shall win shame, loss and rebuke, and if we are
overpowered - what then?</p> 

Working-men of England, I do not believe that in the face of your strenuous
opposition, the opposition of those men whom QWr most concerns, any English
Government will be so mad as to wrap England and Europe in an UNJUST WAR.<p>

<p><br/>"A LOVER OF JUSTICE."</p>

<p>Unjust War: to the Working-men of England</em>.</p>

<h3>Source</h3>

 <p><em>Burnley Gazette,</em> Saturday 12 May 1877, p.7</p>

<h3>Publication</h3>

<p>The manifesto was orignally issued by Morris as a leaflet.  According to
the <em>Northern Echo</em> (p. 3, 11th May 1877), which printed a shortened
version, it was "a placard which is being largely posted in London".  The
leaflet itself (almost identical to the version above) was reprinted as an
appendix to Philip Henderson, <em>The Letters of William MOrris to his
Family and Friends</em>, Longmans 1950.</p>
