<h2>Early England</h2></p>

<p>I am no patriot as the word is generally used; and yet I am
not ashamed to say that as for the face of the land we live
in I love it with something of the passion of a lover: that is
to say more than its beauty or interest in relation to other parts
the earth warrants. Perhaps that is because I am in the habit of
looking at things that pass before my eyes; (which I think has
now ceased to be a common habit) and connecting their present
outward seeming with times gone by and times to come.</p>

<p>Again I will not say that the past history of our country is of
interest so absorbing as to make us forget that of other countries;
nay I know that there is a certain want of romance about it,
compared with other stories of national life, and that as it goes on
it tends ever more and more to the commonplace. But to us who
are come of the actors of it and live amongst the scenes where it
was enacted it has a special interest which consecrates it. Egotism
you will say: well so it is, but under our present conditions and
perhaps for centuries to come an egotism which is natural, and if
we only keep it in order by cultivating our sense of justice to
other nations, and our insight and interest in the history of the
whole world this affection for [our]<sup><a href="#fn1" id="n1">1</a></sup> own parish and the people of
it may even [come] to [be] useful to us and others.</p>

<p>I make these excuses because, as you see by the title of my
 lecture I am going today to confine my story within the limits of
our own island stowed away in an odd corner of the world. What
I want to do is to give you a picture of what has been in England
dwelling almost entirely on the most characteristic periods of its
history, as those which lend themselves most to such a picture; to
say a few words on its present condition so familiar to us all, so
misunderstood by most, so sad to some; and to finish by hazarding
some guesses at what it will be like in times to come: painting
a picture in the air, this last will be I know: and I ask you to
receive it as such.</p>

<p>Now I intend to say scarcely anything about the men of the
earlier times before Caesar crossed the Thames up at Walton
yonder, and his dark, short, close-knit soldiers plunged into the
perilous woods of Middlesex on the other side. Of those earlier
days you may however remember that the records of them are
chiefly to be found on the great chalk downs that run along and
athwart southern England; this will help you to picture to yourselves,
the lowlands covered with marsh and tangled forest, good
only for hunting such beasts as could live there, badger, red deer,
wild swine, wolf, squirrel, and the like; the untended rivers often
spreading out in mere swamp and morass, and the parts habitable by
man the year round the downs, or the slopes of the hills on
which sheep could pasture: there dwelt the earlier, not earliest
inhabitants of Britain, tribe fighting with tribe doubtless, and
therefore raising earthworks on the brows of the hills in which
the whole tribe could gather and drive their flocks and herds for
safety: several races doubtless have used these rude but effective
fortresses; as for instance the great earthwork, called Uffington
Castle, which from the wall of the Wiltshire downs looks over the
fair rich valley of the Thames: there along the ridge of the hill
behind it runs a Roman road, while a furlong from it on the
hill-ridge is the tomb of some chief of the earlier people, which
our Saxon forefathers, when they first came there, seemed so
remote and mysterious that they named it by one of the earliest
of their Gods, the Vulcan of the North, and called it the cave
of Wayland the Smith. {<em>blowing stone</em>} </p>

<p>There also they raised holy places, concerning which endless
guesses have been made, which probably must forever remain
guesses; but at least one may say this of them that the earliest
historical people that found them there seem little nearer to the
builders than we do. Most impressive they are and also most
instructive even amidst their history; the man must be hard to
move indeed who is not moved who as he turns the corner of one
of our commonplace English highways comes suddenly across
that marvellous hedge of grey stones that our Saxon ancestors
called Stonehenge, or looks from the great circular Earthwork of
Avebury on the little old village that lies within it, where the
cottages are cheek by jowl with the few remaining stones of
ancient temple there: lying close by the huge barrow of Silbury,
the hills about all dotted with graves of the early chieftains; the
mysterious Wansdjke drawn across the downs at the back;
wherein even now the horses are tethered when the yearly traditional
horse fair takes place at “Tan Hill." And lastly once more
the Roman road running through it all towards Bath just
swerved a little by the huge mass of Silbury: a familiar place to
my boyhood; yet a holy place indeed. There is a pretty story
current of Aubrey, the Wiltshire archaeologist of the 17th century,
that one day as he was out on the downs hunting or
coursing, he suddenly came across the Earthwork of Avebury and
the Stones of the Temple, then much more numerous than they
are now. He drew rein and sat there musing and at last turned
and rode home soberly, and from that day foreswore hawk and
hound and became a diligent and useful archaeologist.</p>

<p>Well, perhaps the life of these earlier peoples dwelling on the
high lands amidst their flocks and herds in a very elementary
society tending toward the tribal condition, and struggling slowly
into a more elaborate life and greater command over the powers
of nature, is easier to picture than the following periods, when
there were many peoples in Britain and many different conditions
of progress, the time when the Roman servitude first began:
many huge tracts of unsettled land [were] yet left; many of the
tribes were still in a savage state; but there were kingdoms
probably Gaulish, on the East and Southeast which were not only
clear of the savage state but could scarcely perhaps be called
barbarian even; and tillage though interrupted by the wastes and
forests was widely spread; the population generally was ages past
the men of Avebury and Stonehenge. Into this population the
Romans brought ‘the blessings of civilization,' and destroyed the
chances of the natural development of the British tribes, slowly
hammering to pieces all resistance, till they had established the
great taxgathering machine the Roman bureaucracy, the great
curse of the ancient world, as our commercial market-hunting
bureaucracy is the great curse of the modern world.</p>

<p>On the miserable period of this Roman servitude I will not
dwell: the one gift that the Imperial taxgatherers gave to the
island was roads made through it for the safe-conduct of their
bum-bailiffs, which to this day are useful both to thieves, lawyers
and honest men: for the rest it was a matter of course that they
should deprive the unlucky people of all character and public
spirit and so make them an easy prey to the first comers who were
necessitous and bold enough to take hold of the land which it was
no one’s business to defend.</p>

<p>The necessitous and bold newcomers were ready by this time:
from the shores of the Baltic and the North Sea came the tribes of
the English, the Jutes, and the Saxons coolly risking everything
their half-decked or undecked luggers, the men who had long
been a terror to the Roman provincials, who had learned to
expect them on the coast when the weather was so bad that no
civilized keel could keep the sea. {<em>The Count of the Saxon Shore</em>} </p>

<p>These were the men that now fell upon our islands and made a
new set of pictures for us to look on. And before I go further I
should like to clear your minds of a misconception which some
persons by a happy exercise of ignorance and cant have led us
into. These men of the earlier world were rough, predatory, cruel
or at least of ungovernable passions which led them into cruelty;
but there is no parallel between them and the offscourings of our
commercial civilization as certain fifth-rate romanticists are apt to
try to make us believe: the ruffians who are the quite worthy
pioneers of American or English colonial civilization are to the
backbone commercial; they are stockjobbers down on their luck,
and only want a month or two of the ordinary varnish of civilization
to become respectable members of Society; i.e. thieves under
the protection and encouragement of the laws: and take note that
their distinguishing characteristic is ‘vulgarity’ a quality which
in the full signification of the very modern word is a creation of this
century.</p>

<p>Now if you ask me how I know that these terrible sea rovers
who founded the English nation amidst rapine and bloodshed in
these islands were free from this foulest of qualities I can tell you,
first that they bore with them a literature, unwritten of course,
but fragments of which having been afterwards written down are
still left us: and doubtless these early poems at least, in which
language is uncorrupted and has not yet learned to speak with
the double tongue, reflect the mind of the people which produced
them; the epic of Beowulf is worthy of a great people for
its sincerity of language and beauty of expression, and nowhere
lacks the epic quality of putting clear pictures before the readers’
eyes; nor is there <del>anyone else's rights and wrongs</del><sup>anything<sup> in it coarse, ignoble, or degrading; on
the contrary it breathes the very spirit of courageous freedom: to
live is good and to die is good if you are valiant and faithful and
if you reckon great deeds and the fair fame that comes of them of
more account than a few more short years of a trembler’s life
upon the earth. This is the simple ethic of our forefathers, and in
these poems [it] is so set forth that it is clear they really believed
it and that in consequence life amidst all its sufferings and hardships
was a continuous poem to them. In later times it has become
a commonplace and is no longer believed, therefore except
for moments of spasmodic excitement life is dull shapeless, so
that some in their foolish despair will ask, is it worth the living?
Clearly it is not unless we can live fearlessly and confident of our
immortality not as individuals but as a part of the great corporation
of humanity; and that I say was the faith of our forefathers.</p>

<p>And this faith of which these glorious poems are the simple
expression was itself bred of the conditions of life to which the
race had attained: the hideous card-sharping border ruffians of
America and the colonies are terrible to friend and foe alike, pure
individualists, they have nothing to do with anything except the
immediate satisfaction of their own impulses; but the Teutonic
tribes that followed the footsteps of the Roman taxgatherers were
corporate bodies of men united into artificial families for
self-preservation and the satisfaction of the mutual needs of their
members; and these families again were at the point of federating
if they had not already federated into a bigger body ‘the people'
(þeoð). ‘No rights without duties, no duties without rights’ was in
fact the principle which their constitution strove to <em>illustrate
within the limits of the corporation of the family the gens and the
þeoð:</em> so that within those limits it was to their foes rather than
their friends that they were terrible. That limitation is necessary
because outside their tribe or people it was war, and war brought
prisoners sometimes and those prisoners became property and
were called thralls. That is the blot on the constitution of our
forefathers as it was of the ancient Greeks.</p>

<p>Now you must understand that the civilization of which the
Roman Empire was a corruption was founded on the institution
of the city: which means not the mere stones and mortar of the
dwellings of the citizens, but the corporation of which they each
formed a part, yet again the corporation fixed in a certain holy
place: the city was the unit of civilization; outside it was nothing
but confusion. The external aspect of this city-worship, for it was
no less, the Roman domination had retained everywhere, even in
such outlying spots as Britain. But the tribes who gradually
supplanted the Roman Empire on the contrary had no idea of a
city, this of the fixed abode for the gens or tribe or þeoð, the field
amidst the forest rather is the idea of the dwelling of the
germanic tribe. This of course meant a lower form of the development
of Society; but into the Society of the City these tribes
never developed, but their tribalism melted into the society of
feudalism and the Church instead. And it was only where the
influence of the Roman Empire was strong that any semblance of
the ancient city life lasted into the Middle Ages {<em>Italy House Towns</em>}: in England for
instance only those towns have any traces of it that were founded
by the Romans: and it is interesting to note that if you come into
any town which has many parishes such a town is almost
certainly Roman in origin: e.g. Norwich, Yarmouth.</p>

<p>The Anglo-Saxons [who] then came to this country in the
condition of barbarism [were] the most advanced toward that
ancient civilization, which faded away altogether before they
could develop into it. Their want of sympathy with the city life in
the first years of their occupation was almost as marked as that of
the gypsy or the Bedouin for house life. When they took one of
the towns of the Romanized Britons they could not use it; they
sacked it and burned it, and went back again to their own simpler
habitations: you must think of them then at first as dwelling in
farm-steads along the rivers or the sea shore, or in clearings of the
woods, in that field amid the forest of which I was speaking: thus
sprung up those villages with English names all over the country,
each one of which was the settlement of some family or other;
and curiously enough sometimes their names used for constitutional
divisions have outlasted the place itself (hundred of Ossulton — 
where is it?<sup><a href="#fn2" id="n2">2</a></sup>)
nevertheless there was, if there is not now
some stead which was founded by one Oswald and was therefore
called his town. That very word [town] which we now use as the
generic term for a collection of houses and a biggish one at that
shows by change from its original meaning how far removed the
first English were from city life: in Scotland the word is or lately
was used to designate a farmstead merely or the house in it; while
further north the word is still used in its original sense of the
cultivated field around a dwelling as contrasted with the out-meadows
or mere uncultured pasture lands.</p>

<p>Thus then did the tribes from the Baltic found the English
nation in our island, and lived at first not so very differently from
their fathers as they made their way through the great forests of
mid—Europe: their history as read in the books is but a series of
battles with the resisting Britons or chief with chief of their own
blood; yet doubt it not that all the time their home life went on
with something of dignity under the constitution of which I have
hinted: in which every free man had to take his share of
responsibility for carrying on the business of the Community. But as time
passed and <del>centralization grew</del> the limits of the rule of the different Chieftains got
more defined, the tribal feeling waned: the Chiefs and Kings
also, as Mr. Elton<sup><a href="#fn3" id="n3">3</a></sup> says began to inhabit the towns that the
Romans had founded, and the aspect of the great building works
of that most solid-building of peoples struck a chord of melancholy
in the hearts of their poets: here are a few lines from
poem called The Ruin preserved in a volume written in Athelstane’s
time, the sentiment of which differs little from that of our
own time —</p> {<em>Elton 385</em>}<sup><a href="#fn4" id="n4">4</a></sup>

<p>To get done with this matter of the towns I may say also that
other towns besides these Roman cities got founded, some as the
surroundings of Burgs or strong places, some as merchant towns.
But now the Feudal system which was destined to embrace the
customary law of the Germanic tribes and the remains of Roman
authority, mingled here perhaps with some Easternism from New
Rome, began to creep over the country: I tried to put before you
some time ago the way in which feudality naturally developed
from the customs of the tribes [that] conquered the kindred
peoples of Scandinavia, and much the same thing went on in
England, so that by Athelstane’s time there certainly was established
a kind of feudality here; and from that time onward England
was destined to be no longer isolated from the more Romanized
nations of the Continent. Moreover from the time when
Christianity first came amongst them some shades of Rome does
as it were seem to hang over the Early English which the Scandinavian
kingdoms were free from. As far as our early literature is
concerned that was a great misfortune. The history and mythology
of Scandinavia was enshrined in the rough casket of Iceland,
and though at the time when it was written the people of that
island had been converted to Christianity, yet except where the
subject-matter positively demands it there is no sign of the new
religion having made any practical impression on the writers, and
though monks and priests took their part in this literature, works
written in Latin are rare. But in England it was different; the
literature was mostly in the hands of the monks, there are not
many works left us in the vernacular, and of those several of the
most important are paraphrases of bible stories or at least pieces
founded on the Christian mythology of which we have so much
in other forms. There are in Anglo-Saxon in short none of those
pieces of local history told in a terse and amazingly realistic and
dramatic style which bring back to us Iceland and Norway in the
eleventh century: and what is still more unlucky we have lost the
account of the mythology of the North from the Low German
branch of the great Teutonic race: it is the feeblest and slenderest
branch of the Goths that have been the story tellers of the
race and not the Germans or the English: Odin we know in his
goings out and comings in, but Wotan and Woden are but names
to us. And it is a pity indeed; for what there is left of the poems of
the ancient English (apart from Beowulf) show[s] tokens of the
highest and most elevating capacities: no lyrics in the English
language are more beautiful, and few indeed as full of feeling
and true poetic passion as some of those preserved in that “Exeter
book” I have already mentioned.</p>

<p>The turning of the rude kings and chieftains of an outlying
island toward what was once the centre of the civilized world,
and was still the centre of Christianity, has to the mere romanticist
something striking and even pathetic about it: the stream of
pilgrims daring the dangers that then beset the traveller through
central Europe to reach the Eternal City; the kings and queens
that laid their crowns at the feet of the holy father, and died in
the odour of sanctity there: an English Bishop (St. Boniface)
the apostle of the heathen Wends of Prussia and their martyr.
And yet all that pomp of religion does not make up to me for the
loss of the stories I might have had of how the folk of Middlesex
ate and drank and loved and quarrelled and met their death in
the 10th century.</p>

<p>But once more the time was coming when England was to be a
part of Europe; and meantime it seems in spite of the stout men
that dwelt here, she could not hold her own before the Furor
Normanorum that stirred up all Europe that lay anywhere near
the sea. <del>Edgar─the first successful over-king of this island─was in a sense the last successful one.</del> By the time the tribes were fairly settled and the
development of the þeoð into a nation under a feudal king was
going on, the Northmen had fallen on the island, and from that
time till the Norman conquest gave it no rest except when the
whole country was in their power: the English called them generically
Danes but the first comers were from Norway a branch of
the great stream that overran Europe: conquering Normandy,
making yearly inroads right up into France, and North Germany:
the men who carved Norse kingdoms out of Ireland, settled
Iceland, and upheld the throne of the Emperor of the East.
Against this energy, bred doubtless of necessity, the English
could make but little head: the wide extent of sea-board with its
numerous harbours beat them; and you must remember that they
had to meet people who were born seamen while the English of
that day and for centuries afterwards were not a seafaring people.
So that for a time it seemed likely that the whole of society
would be broken up by these bold strong-thieves. For the
invasions of this early period were not for conquest but for
pillage; 'lying out’ was as regular a business with the northern
landholders and yeomen as their ordinary field-work: it is told of an Earl
of the Orkneys that he had two regular viking cruises in the year;
the first after the seed was sown which he called his spring cruise,
the second after it was harvested, called his autumn cruise:
some of the vikings went into partnership with the kings and
shared the proceeds both of peaceful chaffer and fighting: with
the most spirited, well-bred young men it was thought proper
that they should go through a viking cruise for one or two
summers, such as our young gentlemen and noblemen used some 100
years ago to think it necessary to do the grand tour. Once again
you must not fall into the mistake of picturing the men who
partly lived on this woeful industry as being either like the
brigands of romance or the sordid pirates of more modern times
even Captain[s] Teach and Kidd, or like the chivalry of the later
Middle Ages: the greater part of the men who harried England
were when they got back home respectable agriculturalists; yeomen,
or at least landlords who were not ashamed to work with
their own hands: Gunnar, one warrior, is represented as sowing
his cornfield; Arnkel a very great man in Iceland, mending his
own gate. King Sigurd the father of King Harald the Terrible
who fell near York before our King Harald, is found in his hay-field
helping his men get in his hay harvest: the warriors were
shipwrights, housebuilders and armourers, and almost every one
could [s]ettle a copy of verses on occasion. They lived under an
elaborate system of laws which later on were written out at
length, and doubtless had it not been for their narrow and barren
lands their fierce valour would have smouldered away amidst the
peaceful occupations of the land: the sea that fed them drew
them on to waylaying its watery roads. {<em>parallel</em>}</p>

<p>Well whatever they were at home they were a fearful visitation
in the countries that they used as their hunting grounds: the first
thing they did after landing on the coast was to throw themselves
on any body of men that showed fight in order to get horses; for
oddly enough they were as much horsemen as seamen: or they
would row up the rivers, very much higher than we should expect
them to have gone, and throw up an earthwork: you will read
such entries in the Saxon Chronicle as 'This year the Host sailed
up the Seine to Paris and sat a year there.' Another year they
went up the Marne far beyond Paris. They rowed high up the
Lea and entrenched themselves there against Alfred another
time. {<em>In that year the Host which had sat down at Fulham went
over sea to Ghent in France and sat there one year.</em>} Sometimes a band would ally itself with the Welsh chieftains,
sometimes with the Scots. In short the host of the Heathen
was a ceaseless plague in the land and [as] I said seemed about to
reduce it to a state of mere confusion when there appeared on the
scene a man whose pure fame no amount of legend can obscure
and the interest in whom must always win one’s heart however
much his name has been hackneyed, the man born at Wantage in
Berkshire, Alfred the son of Aethelwulf; of whom one must say
that there was one other man of genius who has sat on the throne
in England and that is Oliver Cromwell, and he betrayed the
cause which he had in charge and was mourned by his friends
rather before he died than when he died. But Alfred’s fame was
pure and stainless and both in his shortcomings and his successes
he was human and sympathetic. Yes I think we must call him the
one sole man of genius who ever held an official position among
the English.</p>

<p>Well he began his contest with the Vikings with some hope of
success, fought nine great battles in one year says the S[axon]
Ch[ronicler]: one of them in which he and his brother Aethelred
defeated the heathen and slew Baejsecg and Halfdan their kings,
and was fought at Ashdown some mile from that Uffington Castle
I have told you of, and as his men came back from the fight, they
amused themselves by cutting away the turf from the slope of the
chalk hill so that the white showed on the green in the figure of a
white horse, the beast of their banner done so as to satisfy their
imaginations of the thing: and from that day to this it has abided
there unchanged: and one day this summer I sat on him and
looked down on that fair plain of the Thames, changed enough in
outward seeming from the days of Alfred but how much more in
the ways of life of the people who dwell there!</p>

<p>The battle of Ashdown was pretty much the end of the first act
of Alfred's struggle; the second was a time of defeat and disaster:
but he struggled out of it, and again made head against the host,
defeated it over and over again, made some sort of terms with the
leaders, followed up all who resisted untiringly, and at last
triumphed; the date of Ashdown is 871: in 886 the Chronicler
writes "In this same year Alfred restored London; and all the
Ang!o-race turned to him that were not in the bondage of the
Danish men." Much fighting there was afterwards, but in 897 the
Chronicler could write as if the war was over: “Thanks be to God
the Host had not utterly broken up the Anglo Race.” So that
'England remained England, though the Danish kingdoms of
Northumbria and East Anglia were still a thorn in its side. Successful
kings followed Alfred, who however had plenty of fighting
with the Danes {<em>Brunanburh</em>}, till at last Edgar was acknowledged over-king of
England, and received homage of the Welsh, Scotch, and Danish
kings in England. It seems pretty clear that by his time that
un-Romanized feudal system I have spoken of was fully established
in the country. The king was no longer the head of a clan
or even of a people or þeoð; but the master of the land giving ﬁefs
to the earls and thanes, who in their turn gave them to their free
men. Edgar (died 975) as he was the first over-king of England
was also the last successful one: the Northmen were again at war
with the English regularly and not merely spasmodically: of the
year 994 the Chronicler says — {<em>(quote) (105)</em>)<sup><a href="#fn5" id="n5">5</a></sup></p>


<p>This Olaf was (afterwards, according to the sagas) King of Norway,
and forced Xtianity on his unwilling people: his
history is one of the most splendid and dramatic chapters of the
old Norse king-stories; but the incident has more significance as
regards his fellow king Swein who was king of Denmark: he
opens a new chapter in the story of the Norse invasions; the
earlier ones though not altogether mere pillaging raids, since the
Vikings had their wives and children, aimed rather at settlements
than conquering of the whole kingdom: indeed there was then no
kingdom to conquer, no centralized system of government, which
as we have seen began to develop with Alfred: but now the
struggle took the form of a definite attack by the Danish king on
the English kingdom; which honey-combed by towns and settlements
of his own blood was not hard to conquer: and also things
to judge by the Chronicler were but in a poor way and the
English tendency to muddle of which we have seen so much
since was being well illustrated. {<em>(quote 109)</em>}<sup><a href="#fn6" id="n6">6</a></sup></p>


<p>The attempt at getting quit of the invaders by slaying all the
Danes throughout England bettered matters little if at all: as the
Chronicler laments they did not either pay or fight in time. In the
year 1013 Swein had conquered England; and though he died
soon after and his son Cnut had still a good deal of fighting to do,
he soon became sole king of England.</p>

<p>So fell the country unto foreign kings; but the manners laws
and language of the two peoples were so much alike, that, the
ﬁghting once over, the social condition of the people was little
altered and all would have gone smoothly if things could have
remained thus. But England began more and more to be drawn
into the European whirlpool.</p>

<p>There had for long been a regular intercourse with Rome; there
was a School of the English there, and the Archbishop of Canterbury
had to fetch his pallium thence i.e. his investiture by the
Pope. The art of the English also was necessarily under foreign
influence: it was they who wedded to the strange interlacing
ornament which the Irish developed from the natural growth of
the soil and which had no power of giving even hints at the
human form, the figure drawing deduced from the art of Byzantium,
but which the English probably took from the Germans
who had an art which was an offshoot of the Byzantine style: of
the architecture of the English before the Conquest there are but
few specimens left: probably because their churches were small
for important places, and got rebuilt there in succeeding ages
while in unimportant places they were built of timber as the
ordinary houses were and so perished by lapse of time when
they were not burned down or rebuilt. Scanty however as the
materials for judging of the architecture are they are enough to
tell us that the English had developed a style of their own quite
different from that which the Norman Conquest introduced: the
difference of the styles is the more marked as there is at least one
Norman church in England built before the Conquest, Waltham
Abbey, and one or two Saxon ones built after it. I should mention
that to my mind the Saxon[s] took their architecture from the
German version of the Byzantine style: all things thus tend
towards connecting England with the Continent, it was not long
before the great event came which made England merely a part
of the dominions of a French Duke.</p>

<p>Passing matters helped this forward: for Edward the Confessor
rested on the foreign element as a support against the power of
Earl Godwin and his sons; and gave a kind of a title to the
kingdom to Duke William: discontent grew; a riot at Dover made
by the French favourites was taken up by the Earl as an occasion
to appeal to the people against the King: he sailed up the Thames
to Southwark and lay there a tide, and shot the bridge with the
flood: the king’s men were drawn up to receive him on the
Middlesex shore; and a great battle seemed imminent, but the
hearts of all men misgave them that they should fight Englishmen
against Englishmen; truce was struck, the witan met, and Earl
Godwin was reinstated in his lands and earldom with the goodwill
of all men; the evil customs and laws of the foreigners were
done away with, and all looked hopeful. I have mentioned this
passage about Godwin to show that the Danish blood was by this
time scarcely looked on as alien, since Godwin the popular hero
and supporter of the English customs was in fact a Northman.
Well Edward died amidst these things, but a little after Godwin
and who but Godwin’s son could be king after him; so
Harald, called says one chronicler Harald the Hapless on his
tombstone, became the last king of Early England. I have said
that a[n] English History is apt to lack romance; yet the history
of the great change for good and for evil which connected England
forever with the continent could scarcely be more romantic.
And here above all times does one regret that subjection of the
native writers to monkish Latin, and longs for the story now
never to be written which the English sagaman might have given
us of that field of Hastings. And this all the more as one part
of the story and that the least important part has been told
dramatically enough by an Icelander. For Tostig Harald’s
brother having quarrelled with him and being dispossessed in
consequence, sailed away north and tried to get Swein the Dane-king
to fall on England; and getting the cold shoulder from him
went to Harald the Terrible, king of Norway, a redoubted warrior,
once captain of the guard of the Greek emperor, whom he
enticed into the expedition: the story teller gives us all the usual
preliminaries of a great tragedy in the tales of the north; pithy
Warnings of wise men; omens of seers, and the like; and dwells at
length on the victories won by the Norse Harald before the
English king caught him unawares, his army without their mail
coats six miles from York: the fight that follows and the parley
before it are given in the usual dramatic and generous manner of
the north, and makes one long that such a story teller should have
told us what followed. The news of Duke William’s landing on
Michaelmas-day; the hasty march south of King Harald and his
house-carls, and his muster of an army at the ‘Hoar Apple-tree'
the wedge array drawn up round the king and his brothers round
the Banner of the fighting-man: the oft repulsed charges of
French Horsemen; the breaking up of the wedge-array in pursuit;
and the battle lost but the men still fighting; the arrow shot at a
venture and the death of Harald and his brethren and England
lost and won once more. All this was worthy of being told in more
words than the brief despair of the Chronicler, and in more
life-like manner than the Latin scribbling Monk could compass.</p>

<p>So England fell, and it seems that the people of the country
were not at first conscious of what had happened; but thought of
it as they would of the last fight of Cnut with Edmund Ironside
which simply put a Danish king over them instead of an English
one without changing their social condition: you must remember
that though there was more national feeling then than later on
under the Plantagenets still there was but little. The national
patriotism we are so noisy about now was born much later when
the Middle Ages were ending.</p>

<p>What had happened was serious enough: England had fallen
into the hands of a Romanized landlord and from henceforth was
a part of the great European Feudal System: its development as a
pure branch of the Teutonic family was stopped forever; because
the countries to whom it was now to be bound were, whatever
their blood was, developed from Roman provincials, and had not
even a language of their own, but were compelled to speak a
dialect of Latin.</p>

<p>What might else have happened in the social and political
development of England, if the Frenchmen had been driven out
by Harald, who can say. For my part I doubt if the difference
would have been great. In the next two hundred years the
popular history of Europe is comprised in that of the guilds
which after a long struggle established their control over
industry, yet in the end too late to prevent their falling in the
turn under the double curse of bureaucracy and commercialism,
which grew to be ruling powers as feudalism or the society of
status waned into capitalism or the society of contract. In this
history England took a fair share, and could hardly have done
otherwise considering her position and importance, even had
there been no Duke William and no Hastings; and in these matters
England remained England at all events — with her art and
literature it is different. She almost immediately received a new
architecture, which developing slight differences nevertheless
clung close to that of France, and produced such glorious and
beautiful [buildings] that there is no room for regret left —
literature also became Frenchified and here to its great misfortune as I
think. The great works of the English poets ever since Chaucer’s
time have had to be written in what is little more than a dialect of
French and I cannot help looking on that as a mishap. If we could
only have preserved our language as the Germans have theirs, I
think we with our mingled blood would have made the world
richer than it is now — but these are vain regrets: it is all whistled
down the wind with the last shout of the axes at Senlac: nor do I
ask you to look on it now except as on a series of pictures of the
past.</p>

<p>This was what the axes of Hastings resisted had they known it:
but if they had, and whatever resistance had been attempted the
result would have been the same. The day of centralization and
bureaucracy had to be prepared for: the remains of the tribal
custom of the English supported by a loose approximation to the
Romanized feudality made our forefathers too weak to resist the
shadow of Rome now rising again from the dead in the wrappings
of feudality. Moreover stout-hearted and valiant as they
were they seem to have had a good share of that stupid wastefulness
of which many Englishmen are still proud: to burn the house
down that our Sunday’s beef may be cooked; to lose ten men in a
battle where one would be enough; in fine to reduce ten counties
to the condition of filthy cinder-heaps in order that ten thousand
men may have ten thousand a year each (at other people’s expense
in all ways) [this] is the sort of wastefulness which we have
grown fools enough to be proud of, but which the old Saxon
Chronicler lamented, not without reason: since surely it was one
of the causes that made the brilliant victory at Stamford Bridge
of no account; that broke the wedge-array at Hastings, and laid
Harald the Hapless the last king of the English in a forgotten
grave at Waltham Abbey amidst the streams of Lea River.</p>

<blockquote>Wondrous the wall-stone that Weird hath broken . . . the
roof-tree riven, the grey gates despoiled. Often that wall withstood
Raeghar and Readfah, chieftain after chieftain rising in storm.
Bright was the burgh-place many the princely halls, and high
was the roof of gold ... And the court is dreary, and the
crowned roof lies low in the shadow of the purple arch. Princes
of old time joyous and gold-bright and splendidly-decked, proud
and with wine elate, in war gear shone. They looked on their
treasures, on silver and gems and on stones of price, and on this
bright burgh of their broad realm. The stone court stands, the
hot stream hath whelmed it, there where the bath was hot on
the breast.</blockquote></p>

Benjamin Thorpe's edition of <em>The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</em> (London 1861)
which reads:
 
<blockquote>In this year came Olaf (Anlaf) and Svein to London, on the Nativity
of St. Mary (Sept. 8th), with ninety four ships, and then they were obstinately
fighting against the town, and would have set it on fire. But they there
sustained more harm and evil than they ever weaned that any townsmen could do
to them.  For the holy mother of God, on that day, manifested her mercy to the
townsmen, and delivered them from their foes. And they then went thence, and
wrought the greatest evil that ever any army could do, in burning, and
harrying, and in man-slayings, as well by the sea-coast, as in Essex, and in
Kent, and in Sussex, and in Hampshire. And at last they took them horse, and
rode as far as they would, and were doing unspeakable evil. Then the king and
his “witan” resolved that they should be sent to, and promised tribute and
food, provided that they should cease from ravaging; and they then accepted
that. And all the army then came to Southampton, and there took
winter-quarters; and there they were fed from all the realm of the West Saxons,
and they were paid sixteen thousand pounds of money. Then the king sent bishop
Aelfeah and the aldorman Aethelweard after king Olaf; and the while hostages
were given to the ships; and they then led Olaf with great worship to the king
at Andover. And king Aethelred received him at the bishop’s hand, and royally
gifted him. And Olaf then promised him, as he also fulfilled, that he would
never again come with hostility to England.</blockquote></p>


<p class="information"><a href="#n5" id="fn5">5.</a> The reference is to p. 109 of
Benjamin Thorpe's edition of <em>The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</em> (London 1861)
which reads:
 
<blockquote>An. DCCCC. XCIX. In this year the army again came about
into the Thames, and then went up along the Medway, and to
Rochester. And then the Kentish forces came against them, and
they stoutly engaged together, but alas! that they too quickly
gave way and fled; because they had not the support which they
should have had. And the Danish had possession of the place of
carnage; and then took horses and rode withersoever they themselves
would, and ruined and plundered almost all the West
Kentish. Then the king with his “witen” resolved that they
should be opposed with naval force, and also with a land force.
But when the ships were ready, then they delayed from day to
day, and harrassed the poor people who lay in the ships; and
ever as it should be forwarder, so was it later, and from one time
to another; and ever they let their foes’ army increase, and ever
they receded from the sea, and ever they went forth after them.
And then in the end neither the naval force nor the land force
was productive of anything but the people’s distress, and a waste
of money, and the emboldening of their foes.</blockquote></p>
