<p class="information"><a href="#n2" id="fn2">2.</a> The <em>Chronicle</em>
report of 15th Jan. 1894 records Morris as saying "the Hundred of Ossulton, in
which Hammersmith was situate"</p>

<p class="information"><a href="#n3" id="fn3">3.</a> Much of the information in this talk is taken from Charles Elton, <em>The Origins of English History</em>, London, 1882.</p>
p class="information"><a href="#n3" id="fn3">3.</a> The reference is to the following quote from the Anglo-Saxon poem now known as 'The Ruin':

<blockquote>Wondrous the wall-stone that Weird hath broken . . . the
roof-tree riven, the grey gates despoiled. Often that wall withstood
Raeghar and Readfah, chieftain after chieftain rising in storm.
Bright was the burgh-place many the princely halls, and high
was the roof of gold ... And the court is dreary, and the
crowned roof lies low in the shadow of the purple arch. Princes
of old time joyous and gold-bright and splendidly-decked, proud
and with wine elate, in war gear shone. They looked on their
treasures, on silver and gems and on stones of price, and on this
bright burgh of their broad realm. The stone court stands, the
hot stream hath whelmed it, there where the bath was hot on
the breast.</blockquote></p>

<p class="information"><a href="#n4" id="fn4">4.</a> The reference is to p. 105 of
Benjamin Thorpe's edition of <em>The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</em> (London 1861)
which reads:
 
<blockquote>In this year came Olaf (Anlaf) and Svein to London, on the Nativity
of St. Mary (Sept. 8th), with ninety four ships, and then they were obstinately
fighting against the town, and would have set it on fire. But they there
sustained more harm and evil than they ever weaned that any townsmen could do
to them.  For the holy mother of God, on that day, manifested her mercy to the
townsmen, and delivered them from their foes. And they then went thence, and
wrought the greatest evil that ever any army could do, in burning, and
harrying, and in man-slayings, as well by the sea-coast, as in Essex, and in
Kent, and in Sussex, and in Hampshire. And at last they took them horse, and
rode as far as they would, and were doing unspeakable evil. Then the king and
his “witan” resolved that they should be sent to, and promised tribute and
food, provided that they should cease from ravaging; and they then accepted
that. And all the army then came to Southampton, and there took
winter-quarters; and there they were fed from all the realm of the West Saxons,
and they were paid sixteen thousand pounds of money. Then the king sent bishop
Aelfeah and the aldorman Aethelweard after king Olaf; and the while hostages
were given to the ships; and they then led Olaf with great worship to the king
at Andover. And king Aethelred received him at the bishop’s hand, and royally
gifted him. And Olaf then promised him, as he also fulfilled, that he would
never again come with hostility to England.</blockquote></p>


<p class="information"><a href="#n5" id="fn5">5.</a> The reference is to p. 109 of
Benjamin Thorpe's edition of <em>The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</em> (London 1861)
which reads:
 
<blockquote>An. DCCCC. XCIX. In this year the army again came about
into the Thames, and then went up along the Medway, and to
Rochester. And then the Kentish forces came against them, and
they stoutly engaged together, but alas! that they too quickly
gave way and fled; because they had not the support which they
should have had. And the Danish had possession of the place of
carnage; and then took horses and rode withersoever they themselves
would, and ruined and plundered almost all the West
Kentish. Then the king with his “witen” resolved that they
should be opposed with naval force, and also with a land force.
But when the ships were ready, then they delayed from day to
day, and harrassed the poor people who lay in the ships; and
ever as it should be forwarder, so was it later, and from one time
to another; and ever they let their foes’ army increase, and ever
they receded from the sea, and ever they went forth after them.
And then in the end neither the naval force nor the land force
was productive of anything but the people’s distress, and a waste
of money, and the emboldening of their foes.</blockquote></p>
