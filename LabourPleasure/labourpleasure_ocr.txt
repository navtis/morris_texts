VERS US 

LABOUR AND SORROW. 


“ And the men of labour spent their strength in daily 
stragglings for breath to maintain the vital strength 
they laboured with : so living in a daily circulation 
of sorrow , living but to work, and working but to 
live, as if daily bread were the only end of a 
wearisome life , and a wearisome life the only 
occasion of daily bread A

A D DRESS. 


1 STAND before you this evening weighted with a dis¬ 
advantage that I did not feel last year;—I have little 

-fresh to tell you ; I can somewhat enlarge on what I 

said then ; here and there I may make bold to give you a practical 
suggestion, or I may put what I have to say in a way that will be 
clearer to some of you perhaps; but my message is really the same 
as it was when I first had the pleasure of meeting you. 

It is true that, if all were going smoothly with art, or at all 
events so smoothly that there were but a few mal-contents in the 
world, you might listen with some pleasure, and perhaps advantage 
to the talk of an old hand in the craft concerning ways of work, 
the snares that beset success, and the shortest road to it; to a tale 
of workshop receipts and the like : that would be pleasant talk 
surely between friends and fellow workmen ; but it seems to me as 
if it were not for us as yet; nay, maybe we may live long and find 
no time fit for such restful talk as the cheerful histories of the 
hopes and fears of our workshops: anyhow to-night I cannot do 
it, but must once again call the faithful of art to a battle wider 
and more distracting than that kindly struggle with nature, to which 
all true craftsmen are born ; which is both the building-up and 
the wearing-away of their lives. 










4 


As I look round on this assemblage, and think of all that it 
represents, I cannot choose but be moved to the soul by the 
troubles of the life of civilised man, and the hope that thrusts 
itself through them; I cannot refrain from giving you once again 
the message with which, as it seems, some chance-hap has charged 
me : that message is, in short, to call on you to face the latest 
danger civilisation is threatened with, a danger of her own breed¬ 
ing : that men in struggling towards the complete attainment of all 
the luxuries of life for the strongest portion of their race should 
deprive their whole race of all the heauty of life : a danger that the 
strongest and wisest of mankind, in striving to attain to a complete 
mastery over nature should destroy her simplest and widest-spread 
gifts, and thereby enslave simple people to them, and themselves 
to themselves, and so at last drag the world into a second barbarism 
more ignoble, and a thousandfold more hopeless than the first. 

Now of you who are listening to me, there are some, I feel 
sure, who have received this message, and taken it to heart, and 
are day by day fighting the battle that it calls on you to fight: to 
you I can say nothing but that if any word I speak discourage 
you, I shall heartily wish I had never spoken at all: but to be shown 
the enemy, and the castle we have got to storm, is not to be bidden 
to run from him ; nor am I telling you to sit down deedless in the 
desert because between you and the promised land lies many a 
trouble, and death itself maybe : the hope before you you know, and 
nothing that I can say can take it away from you : but friend may 
with advantage cry out to friend in the battle that a stroke is 
coming from this side or that : take my hasty words in that sense, 
I beg of you. 

But I think there will be others of you in whom vague dis¬ 
content is stirring: who are oppressed by the life that surrounds 
you, confused and troubled by that oppression, and not knowing 
on which side to seek a remedy though you are fain to do so: 
well, we, who have gone further into those troubles, believe that we 
can help you : true we cannot at once take your trouble from you ; 
















5 

nay, we may at first rather add to it; but we can tell you what we 
think of the way out of it; and then amidst the many things you 
will have to do to set yourselves and others fairly on that way, you 
will many days, nay most days, forget your trouble in thinking of 
the good that lies beyond it, for which you are working. 

But again there are others amongst you (and to speak plainly, 
I daresay they are the majority), who are not by any means troubled 
by doubt of the road the world is going, nor excited by any hope 
of its bettering that road : to them the cause of civilisation is simple 
and even common-place : wonder, hope and fear no longer hang 
about it; it has become to us like the rising and setting of the sun, 
it cannot err, and we have no call to meddle with it, either to 
complain of its course, or to try to direct it. 

There is a ground of reason and wisdom in that way of 
looking at the matter : surely the world will go on its ways, thrust 
forward by impulses which we cannot understand or sway: but as 
it grows in strength for the journey, its necessary food is the life and 
aspirations of all of us : and we discontented strugglers with what 
at times seems the hurrying blindness of civilisation, no less than 
those who see nothing but smooth unvarying progress in it, are 
bred of civilisation also, and shall be used up to further it in some 
way or other, I doubt not : and it may be of some service to those 
who think themselves the only loyal subjects of progress to hear 
of our existence, since their not hearing of it would not make an 
end of it: it may set them a thinking not unprofitably to hear of 
burdens that they do not help to bear, but which are nevertheless 
real and weighty enough to some of their fellow men, who are 
helping, even as they are, to form the civilisation that is to be. 

The danger that the present course of civilisation will destroy 
the beauty of life — these are hard words, and I wish I could mend 
them, but I cannot while I speak what 1 believe to be the truth. 

That the beauty of life is a thing of no moment, I suppose 
few people would venture to assert, and yet most civilised people 
act as if it were of none, and in so doing are wronging both 















6 



themselves and those that are to come after them; for that beauty, 
which is what is meant by art , using the word in its widest sense, 
is, I contend, no mere accident to human life, which people can 
take or leave as they choose, but a positive necessity of life, if we 
are to live as nature meant us to; that is, unless we are content to 
be less than men. 

Now I ask you, as I have been asking myself this long while, 
what proportion of the population in civilised countries has any 
share at all in that necessity of life ? 

I say that the answer which must be made to that question 
justifies my fear that modern civilisation is on the road to trample 
out all the beauty of life, and to make us less than men. 

Now if there should be any here who will say; it was always 
so; there always was a mass of rough ignorance that knew and 
cared nothing about art; I answer first, that if that be the case, then 
it was always wrong, and we, as soon as we have become conscious 
of that wrong, are bound to set it right if we can. 

But moreover, strange to say, and in spite of all the suffering 
that the world has wantonly made for itself, and has in all ages so 
persistently clung to, as if it were a good and holy thing, this wrong 
of the mass of men being regardless of art was not always so. 

So much is now known of the periods of art that have left 
abundant examples of their work behind them, that we can judge 
of the art of all periods by comparing these with the remains of 
times of which less has been left us; and we cannot fail to come 
to the conclusion that down to very recent days everything that the 
hand of man touched was more or less beautiful: so that in those 
days all people who made anything shared in art, and all people 
who used the things so made : that is, all people shared in art. 

But some people may say; and was that to be wished for; 
would not this universal spreading of art stop progress in other 
matters, hinder the work of the world ? Would it not make us 
unmanly ? or if not that, would it not be intrusive, and push out 
other things necessary also for men to study ? 

























Well, I have claimed a necessary place for art, a natural place, 
and it would be in the very essence of it, that it would apply its own 
rules of order and fitness to the general ways of life : it seems to 
me, therefore, that people who are over-anxious of the outward 
expression of beauty becoming too great a force among the other 
forces of life, would, if they had had the making of the external 
world, have been afraid of making an ear of wheat beautiful, lest 
it should not have been good to eat. 

But indeed there seems no chance of art becoming universal, 
unless on the terms that it shall have little self-consciousness, and 
for the most part he done with little effort; so that the rough work 
of the world would be as little hindered by it, as the work of 
external nature is by the beauty of all her forms and moods : this 
was the case in the times that 1 have been speaking of: of art 
which was made by conscious effort, by the individual striving 
towards perfect expression of their thoughts by men very specially 
gifted, there was perhaps no more than there is now, except in 
very wonderful and short periods; though I believe that even for 
such men the struggle to produce beauty was not so bitter as it 
now is. But if there were not more great thinkers than there are 
now, there was a countless multitude of happy workers whose work 
did express, and could not choose but express some original thought, 
and was consequently both interesting and beautiful: now there is 
certainly no chance of the more individual art becoming common, 
and either wearying us by its over abundance or, by noisy self- 
assertion, preventing highly cultivated men taking their due part in 
the other work of the world; it is too difficult to do : it will be always 
but the blossom of all the half-conscious work below it, the fulfil¬ 
ment of the shortcomings of less complete minds : but it will waste 
much of its power, and have much less influence on men’s minds 
unless it be surrounded by abundance of that commoner work, in 
which all men once shared, and which, I say, will, when art has 
really awakened, be done so easily and constantly, that it will stand 
in no man’s way to hinder him from doing what he will, good or 



















8 


evil. And as on the one hand I believe that art made by the 
people and for the people as a joy both to the maker and the user 
would further progress in other matters rather than hinder it; so 
also I firmly believe that that higher art produced only by great 
brains and miraculously gifted hands cannot exist without it: I 
believe that the present state of things in which it does exist, while 
popular art is, let us say, asleep or sick, is a transitional state, 
which must end at last either in utter defeat or utter victory for 
the arts. 

For whereas all works of craftsmanship were once beautiful, 
unwittingly or not, they are now divided into two kinds, works of 
art and non-works of art: now nothing made by man’s hand can 
be indifferent; it must be either beautiful and elevating, or ugly 
and degrading; and those things that are without art are so 
agressively, they wound it by their existence, and they are now so 
much in the majority, that the works of art we are obliged to set 
ourselves to seek for, whereas the other things are the ordinary 
companions of our everyday life; so that if those who cultivate art 
intellectually were inclined never so much to wrap themselves in 
their special gifts and their high cultivation, and so live happily, 
apart from other men, and despising them, they could not do so: 
they are as it were living in an enemy’s country; at every turn 
there is something lying in wait to offend and vex their nicer sense 
and educated eyes : they must share in the general discomfort,— 
and I am glad of it. 

So the matter stands : from the first dawn of history till quite 
modern times, art, which nature meant to solace all, fulfilled its 
purpose; all men shared in it: that was what made life romantic, 
as people call it, in those days; that and not robber-barons and 
inaccessible kings with their hierarchy of serving-nobles and other 
such rubbish : but art grew and grew, saw empires sicken and 
sickenened with them ; grew hale again, and haler, and grew so 
great at last, that she seemed in good truth to have conquered 
everything, and laid the material world under foot. Then came a 


































9 

change at a period of the greatest life and hope in many ways that 
Europe had known till then : a time of so much and varied hope 
that people call it the time of the New Birth : as far as the arts are 
concerned I deny it that title; rather it seems to me that the 
great men who lived and glorified the practice of art in those days, 
were the fruit of the old, not the seed of the new order of things: 
but a stirring and hopeful time it was, and many things were new¬ 
born then which have since brought forth fruit enough : and it is 
strange and perplexing that, from that time forward the lapse of 
time, which, through plenteous confusion and failure, has on the 
whole been steadily destroying priviledge and exclusiveness in other 
matters, has delivered up art to be the exclusive priviledge of a 
few, and has taken from the people their birthright; while both 
" ron £ e d and wrongers have been wholly unconscious of what they 
were doing. 

Wholly unconscious—yes, but we are no longer so : there lies 
the sting of it, and there also the hope. 

When the brightness of the so-called Rennaissance faded, 
and it faded very suddenly, a deadly chill fell upon the arts : that 
New-birth mostly meant looking back to past times, wherein the men 
of those days thought they saw a perfection of art, which to their 
minds was different in kind, and not in degree only, from the ruder 
suggestive art of their own fathers: this perfection they were 
ambitious to imitate, this alone seemed to be art to them, the rest 
was childishness: so wonderful was their energy, their success so 
great, that no doubt to commonplace minds among them, though 
surely not to the great masters, that perfection seemed to be 
gained : and, perfection being gained, what are you to do; you 
can go no further, you must aim at standing still—which you 
cannot do. 

Art by no means stood still in those latter days of the 
Rennaissance, but took the downward road with terrible swiftness, 
and tumbled down at the bottom of the hill, where as if bewitched 
it lay long in great content, believing itself to be the art of 
















Michael Angelo, while it was the art of men whom nobody 
remembers but those who want to sell their pictures. 

Thus it fared with the more individual forms of art: as to 
the art of the people, in countries and places where the greater art 
had flourished most, it went step by step on the downward path 
with that: in more out-of-the-way places, England for instance, it 
still felt the influence of the life of its earlier and happier days, 
and in a way lived on a while ; but its life was so feeble, and, so 
to say, illogical, that it could not resist any change in external 
circumstances, still less could it give birth to anything new; and 
before this century began, its last flicker had died out. Still, while 
it was living, in whatever dotage, it did imply something going on 
in those matters of daily use that we have been thinking of, and 
doubtless satisfied some cravings for beauty: and when it was 
dead, for a long time people did not know it, or what had taken 
its place, crept so to say into its dead body—that pretence of art, 
to wit, which is done with machines, though sometimes the 
machines are called men, and doubtless are so out of working 
hours : nevertheless long before it was quite dead it had fallen so low 
that the whole subject was usually treated with the utmost contempt 
by everyone who had any pretence of being a sensible man, and in 
short the whole civilised world had forgotten that there had ever 
been an art made by /be people for the people as a joy for the 
maker and the user. 

But now it seems to me that the very suddenness of the 
change ought to comfort us, to make us look upon this break in 
the continuity of the golden chain as an accident only, that itself 
cannot last: for think, how many thousand years it may be since 
that primaeval man graved with a flint splinter on a bone the story 
of the mammoth he had seen, or told us of the slow uplifting of 
the heavily-horned heads of the rein-deer that he stalked: think I 
say of the space of time from then till the dimming of the bright¬ 
ness of the Italian Rennaissance ! whereas from that time till 

popular art died unnoticed and despised among ourselves is just 
but 200 years. 






















Strange too, that very death is contemporaneous with new- 
birth of something at all events; for out of all despair sprang a 
new time of hope lighted by the torch of the French Revolution : 
and things that had languished with the languishing of art, rose 
afresh and surely heralded its new birth : in good earnest poetry 
was born again, and the English Language which under the 
hands of sycophantic verse-makers had been reduced to a miserable 
jargon, whose meaning if it have a meaning, cannot be made out 
without translation, flowed clear, pure, and simple, along with the 
music of Blake and Coleridge: take those names, the earliest in 
date among ourselves, as a type of the change that has happened 
in literature since the time of George II. 

With \h at literature in which romance, that is to say humanity, 
was re-born, there sprang up also a feeling for the romance of 
extenial_oature, which Is surely strong in us now, joined with a 
long ing to know something real of the lives of those who have 
gone before us; of these feelings united you will find the broadest 
^expression in the pages of Walter Scott: it is curious as showing 
how sometimes one art will lag behind another in a revival, that 
the man who wrote the exquisite and wholly unfettered naturalism 
' OT the Heart of Midlothian, for instance, thought himself con¬ 
tinually bound to seem to feel ashamed of, and to excuse himself 
for his love of Gothic Architecture : he felt that it was romantic 
and he knew that it gave him pleasure, but somehow he had not 
found out that it was art, having been taught in many ways that 
nothing could be art that was not done by a named man under 
academical rules. 

I need not perhaps dwell much on what of change has been 
since: you know well that one of the master-arts, the art of 
painting has been revolutionised. I have a genuine difficulty in 
speaking to you of men who are my own personal friends, nay my 
masters: still since I cannot quite say nothing of them I must say 
the plain truth, which is this; never in the whole history of art did 




























any set of men rome nearer to the feat of making something out 
of nothing than that little knot of painters who raised English art 



Exhibition, to what it is now. 


It would be ungracious indeed for me who have been so 
much taught by him, that I cannot help feeling continually as I 
speak that I am echoing his words, to leave out the name of 
John Ruskin from an account of what has happened since the 
tide, as we hope, began to turn in the direction of art. True it is, 
that his unequalled style of English and his wonderful eloquence 
would, whatever its subject-matter, have gained him some sort of a 
hearing in a time that has not lost its relish for literature ; but 
surely the influence that he has exercised over cultivated people 
must he the result of that style and that eloquence expressing 
what was already stirring in men’s minds; he could not have 
written what he has done unless people were in some sort ready for 
it; any more than those painters could have begun their crusade 
against the dulness and incompetency that was the rule in their 
art thirty years ago, unless they had some hope that they would 
one day move people to understand them. 

.ii^ll^ejflnd that the gains since the turning-point of the tide 
are these : that there are some few artists who have, as 
Taught up the golden chain dropped two hundred^ears ago, and 
that there are a few highly cultivated people who can understand 
them ; and that beyond these there is a vague feeling abroad among 
people of the same degree, of discontent at the ignoble ugliness 
that surrounds them. 

That seems to me to mark the advance that we have made 
since the last of popular art came to an end amongst us, and I do 
not say, considering where we then were, that it is not a great 
advance, for it comes to this, that though the battle is still to win, 
there are those who are ready for the battle. 

Indeed it would be a strange shame for this age if it were not 
so: for as every age of the world has its own troubles to confuse 




































*3 


it and its own follies to cumber it, so has each its own work to do, 
pointed out to it by unfailing signs of the times; and it is unmanly 
and stupid for the children of any age to say: we will not set our 
hands to the work ; we did not make the troubles, we will not 
weary ourselves seeking a remedy for them : so heaping up for 
their sons a heavier load than they can lift without such struggles 
as will wound and cripple them sorely. Not thus our fathers 
served us, who, working late and early, left us at last that seething 
mass of people so terribly alive and energetic, that we call modern 
Europe; not thus those served us, who have made for us these 
present days, so fruitful of change and wondering expectation. 

The century that is now drawing to an end, if people were to 
take to nick-naming centuries, would be called the Century of Com¬ 
merce ; and I do not think I undervalue the work that it has done : 
it has broken down many a prejudice and taught many a lesson that 
the world has been hitherto slow to learn : it has made it possible for 
many a man to live free, who would in other times have been a 
slave, body or soul, or both : if it has not quite spread peace and 
justice through the world, as at the end of its first half we fondly 
hoped it would, it has at least stirred up in many fresh cravings 
for peace and justice: its work has been good and plenteous, hut 
much of it was roughly done, as needs was ; recklessness has 
commonly gone with its energy, blindness too often with its haste: 
so that perhaps it may be work enough for the next century to 
repair the blunders of that recklessness, to clear away the rubbish 
which that hurried work has piled up : nay even we in the second 
half of its last quarter may do something towards setting its house 
in order. 

You, of this great and famous town, for instance, which has 
had so much to do with the Century of Commerce : your gains are 
obvious to all men, but the price you have paid for them is obvious 
to many—surely to yourselves most of all : I do not say that they 
are not worth the price; I know that England and the world could 
very ill afford to exchange the Birmingham of to-day for the 


















14 



Birmingham of the year 1,700 : but surely if what you have gained 
be more than a mockery, you cannot stop at those gains, or even 
go on always piling up similar ones. Nothing can make me 
believe that the present condition of your Black Country yonder is 
an unchangeable necessity of your life and position : such miseries 
as this were begun and carried on in pure thoughtlessness, and 
a hundredth part of the energy that was spent in creating them 
would get rid of them : I do think if we were not all of us too 
prone to acquiesce in the base bye word ‘ after me the deluge,’ it 
would soon be something more than an idle dream to hope that 
your pleasant midland hills and fields might begin to become 
pleasant again in some way or other, even without depopulating 
them ; or that those once lovely valleys of Yorkshire in the ‘heavy 
woollen district,’ with their sweeping hill-sides and noble rivers 
should not need the stroke of ruin to make them once more 
delightful abodes of man, instead of the dog-holes that the 
Century of Commerce has made them. 

Well, people will not take the trouble or spend the money 
necessary to beginning these sort of reforms, because they do not 
feel the evils they live amongst, because they have degraded 
themselves into something less than men; they are unmanly 
because they have ceased to have their due share of art. 

For again I say that herein rich people have defrauded 
themselves' as well as the poor : you will see a refined and highly 
educated man now-a-days, who has been to Italy and Egypt, and 
where not, who can talk learnedly enough, (and fantastically 
enough sometimes) about art, and who has at his fingers’ ends 
abundant lore concerning the art and literature of past days, 
sitting down without signs of discomfort in a house, that with 
all its surroundings is just brutally vulgar and hideous: all his 
education has not done more for him than that. 

The truth is, that in art, and in other things besides, the 
laboured education of a few will not raise even those few above 
the reach of the evils that beset the ignorance of the great mass 



















i5 


of the population : the brutality, of which such a huge stock has 
been accumulated lower down, will often show without much peel¬ 
ing through the selfish refinement of those who have let it accumu¬ 
late. The lack of art, or rather the murder of art that curses our 
streets from the sordidness of the surroundings of the lower 
classes, has its exact counterpart in the dulness and vulgarity of 
those of the middle classes, and the double-distilled dulness and 
scarcely less vulgarity of those of the upper classes. 

I say this is as it should be ; it is just and fair as far as it 
goes; and moreover the rich with their leisure are the more like 
to move if they feel the pinch themselves. 

But how shall they and we, and all of us move ? What is 
the remedy? 

What remedy can there be for the blunders of civilisation 
but further civilisation? You do not by any accident think that 
we have gone as far in that direction as it is possible to go, do 
you ?—even in England I mean ? 

When some changes have come to pass, that perhaps will be 
speedier than most people think, doubtless education* will both 
grow in quality and in quantity; so that it may be, that as the 
ninteenth century is to be called the Century of Commerce, the 
twentieth may be called the Century of Education. But that 
education does not end when people leave school is now a mere 
commonplace ; and how then can you really educate men who 
lead the life of machines, who only think for the few hours during 
which they are not at work, who in short spend almost their whole 
lives in doing work which is not proper for developing them body 
and mind in some worthy way ? You cannot educate, you cannot 
civilise men, unless you can give them a share in art. 

Yes, and it is hard indeed as things go to give most men that 
share; for they do not miss it, or ask for it, and it is impossible as 
things are that they should either miss, or ask for it. Nevertheless 
everything has a beginning, and many great things have had very 
small ones ; and since, as I have said, these ideas are already abroad 


















i6 




in more than one form, we must not be too much discouraged at 
the seemingly boundless weight we have to lift. 

After all, we are only bound to play our own parts, and do 
our own share of the lifting; and as in no case that share can be 
great, so also in all cases it is called for, it is necessary. Therefore 
let us work and faint not; remembering that though it be natural, 
and therefore excusable, amidst doubtful times to feel doubts of 
success oppress us at whiles, yet not to crush those doubts, and 
work as if we had them not, is simple cowardice, which is 
unforgivable. No man has any right to say that all has been done 
for nothing, that all the faithful unwearying strife of those that 
have gone before us shall lead us no whither ; that mankind will 
but go round and round in a circle for ever: no man has a right 
to say that, and then get up morning after morning to eat his 
victuals and sleep a-nights, all the while making other people toil 
to keep his worthless life a-going. 

Be sure that some way or other will be found out of the 
tangle, even when things seem most tangled, and be no less sure 
that some use will then have come of our work, if it has been 
faithful, and therefore unsparingly careful and thoughtful. 

So once more I say, if in any matters civilisation has gone 
astray, the remedy, lies not in standing still, but in more complete 
civilisation. 

Now whatever discussion there may be about that often used, 
and often misused word, I believe all who hear me will agree with 
me in believing from their hearts, and not merely in saying in 
conventional phrase, that the civilisation which does not carry the 
whole people with it, is doomed to fall, and give place to one which 
at least aims at doing so. 

We talk of the civilisation of the ancient peoples, of the 
classical times : well, civilised they were no doubt, some of their 
folk at least: an Athenian citizen tor instance led a simple, 
dignified, almost perfect life; but there were draw-backs to 
happiness perhaps in the life of his Slaves: and the civilisation of 
the ancients was founded on Slavery.

Indeed that ancient society did give a model to the world, 
and showed us for ever what blessings are freedom of life and 
thought, self-restraint and a generous education : all those blessings 
the ancient free peoples set forth to the world—and kept them to 
themselves. 

Therefore no tyrant was too base, no pretext too hollow for 
enslaving the grandsons of the men of Salamis and Thermopylae: 
therefore did the descendants of those stern and self-restrained 
Romans, who were ready to give up everything, and life as the 
least of things, to the glory of their commonweal, produce monsters 
of licence and reckless folly. Therefore did a little knot of Gallilean 
peasants overthrow the Roman Empire.

Ancient civilisation was chained to slavery and exclusiveness, 
and it fell; the barbarism that took its place has delivered us from 
slavery and grown into modern civilisation ; and that in its turn 
has before it the choice of never-ceasing growth, or destruction by 
that which has in it the seeds of higher growth. 

There is an ugly word for a dreadful fact, which I must make 
bold to use- the residuum : the first time I noticed the word much 
it was used by a great man, whose name I must not mention here, 
I suppose ; nor do I wish to shelter myself behind his name : but 
ever since his fearless eloquence called my attention to it, 
that word has had a terrible significance to me, and I have 
felt from my heart that if this residuum were a necessary 
part of modern civilisation, as some people openly, and many more 
tacitly assume that it is, then this civilisation carries with it the 
poison that shall one day destroy it, even as its elder sister did : 
if civilisation is to go no further than this, it had better not have 
gone so far: if it does not aim at getting rid of this misery and 
giving some share in the happiness and dignity of life to all the 
people that it has created, and which it spends such unwearying 
energy in creating, it is simply an organized injustice, a mere 
instrument for oppression, so much the worse than that which has 
















gone before it, as its pretensions are higher, its slavery subtler, its 
mastery harder to overthrow, because supported by such a dense 
mass of commonplace well-being and comfort. 

Surely this cannot be: surely there is a distinct feeling 
abroad of this injustice : so that if the residuum still clogs all the 
efforts of modern civilisation to rise above mere population¬ 
breeding and money-making, the difficulty of dealing with it is the 
legacy, first of the ages of violence and almost conscious brutal 
injustice, and next of the ages of thoughtlessness, of hurry and 
blindness : surely all those who think at all of the future of the 
world are at work in one way or other in striving to rid it of this 
shame. 

That to my mind is the meaning of what we call National 
Education, which we have begun, and which is doubtless already 
bearing its fruits, and will bear greater, when all people are 
educated, not according to the money which they or their parents 
possess, but according to the capacity of their minds. 

What effect that will have upon the future of the arts, I 
cannot say, but one would surely think a very great effect; for it 
will enable people to see clearly many things which are now as 
completely hidden from them as if they were blind in body and 
idiotic in mind : and this, I say, will act not only upon those who 
most directly feel the evils of ignorance, but also upon those who 
feel them indirectly,—upon us, the educated : the great wave of 
rising intelligence, rife with so many natural desires and aspirations, 
will carry all classes along with it, and force us all to see that 
many things which we have been used to look upon as necessary 
and eternal evils are merely the accidental and temporary growths 
of past stupidity, and can be escaped from by due effort, and the 
exercise of courage, goodwill, and forethought. 

And among those evils, I do, and must always, believe 
will fall that one which last year I told you that I accounted 
the greatest of all evils, the heaviest of all slaveries; that evil 
ot the greater part of the population being engaged for by 
















*9 


far the most part of their lives in work, which at the best 
cannot interest them, or develope their best faculties, and at 
the worst (and that is the commonest, too), is mere unmiti¬ 
gated slavish toil, only to be wrung out of them by the 
sternest compulsion, a toil which they shirk all they can—small 
blame to them. And this toil degrades them into less than men ; 
and they will some day come to know it, and cry out to be made 
men again, and art only can do it, and redeem them from this 
slavery; and I say once more that this is her highest and most 
glorious end and aim; and it is in her struggle to attain to it that 
she will most surely purify herself, and quicken her own aspirations 
towards perfection. 

But we—in the meantime we must not sit waiting for obvious 
signs of these later and glorious days to show themselves on earth, 
and in the heavens, but rather turn to at the commonplace, and 
maybe often dull work of fitting ourselves in detail to take part 
in them if we should live to see one of them; or in doing our 
best to make the path smooth for their coming, if we are to die 
before they are here. 

What, therefore, can we do, to guard traditions of time past 
that we may not one day have to begin anew from the beginning 
with none to teach us ? What are we to do, that we may take 
heed to, and spread the decencies of life, so that at the least we 
may have a field where it will be possible for art to grow when 
men begin to long for it: what finally can we do, each of us, to 
cherish some germ, of art, so that it may meet with others, and 
spread and grow little by little into the thing that we need ? 

Now L cannot pretend to think that the first of these duties 
is a matter of indifference to you, after my experience of the 
enthusiastic meeting that I had the honour of addressing here 
last autumn on the subject of the (so-called) restoration of St. 
Mark’s at Venice; you thought, and most justly thought, is seems 
to me that the subject was of such moment to art in general, that 
it was a simple and obvious thing for men who were anxious on 





















20 


the matter to address themselves to those who had the decision of 
it in their hands ; even though the former were called Englishmen, 
and the latter Italians; for you felt that the name of lovers of art 
would cover those differences: if you had any misgivings, you re¬ 
membered that there was but one such building in the world, and 
that it was worth while risking a breach of etiquette, if any words 
of ours could do anything towards saving it: well, the Italians 
were, some of them, very naturally, though surely unreasonably, 
irritated, for a time, and in some of their prints they bade us, look 
at home 1 that was no argument in favour of the wisdom of 
wantonly rebuilding St. Mark’s fa&lt;;ade: but certainly those of us 
who have not yet looked at home in this matter had better do so 
speedily, late and over late though it be: for though we have no 
golden pictured interiors like St. Mark’s Church at home, we still 
have many buildings which are both works of ancient art and 
monuments of history: and just think what is happening to them, 
and note, since we profess to recognize their value, how helpless 
art is in the Century of Commerce ! 

In the first place many and many a beautiful and ancient 
building is being destroyed all over civilised Europe as well as in 
England because it is supposed to interfere with the convenience 
of the citizens, while a little forethought might save it without 
trenching on that convenience; but even apart from that, I say 
that if we are not prepared to put up with a little inconvenience in 
our life-times for the sake of preserving a monument of art which 
will elevate and educate, not only ourselves, but our sons, and our 
sons’ sons, it is vain and idle of us to talk about art—or education 
either. Brutality must be bred of such brutality. 

The same thing may be said about enlarging or otherwise 
altering for convenience sake old buildings still in use for some¬ 
thing like their original purposes : in almost all such cases it is 
really nothing more than a question of a little money for a new 
site; and then a new building can be built exactly fitted for the 
uses it is needed for, with such art about it as our own days can 














furnish ; while the old monument is left to tell its tale of change 
and progress, to hold out example and warning to us in the practice 
of the arts : and thus the convenience of the public, the progress 
of modern art and the cause of education are all furthered at once 
a t the cost of ajittle money. 

Surely if it be worth while troubling ourselves about the 
works of art of to-day, of which any amount almost can be done, 
since we are yet alive, it is worth while spending a little care, fore¬ 
thought, and money in preserving the art of by-gone ages, of 
which (woe worth the while 1) so little is left, and of which we can 
never have any more, whatever good-hap the world may attain to. 

No man who consents to the destruction or the mutilation of 
an ancient building has any right to pretend that he cares about 
art; or has any excuse to plead in defence of his crime against 
civilisation and progress, save sheer brutal ignorance. 

But before I leave this subject I must say a word or two about 
the curious invention of our own days called Restoration, a method 
of dealing with works of by-gone days which though not so 
degrading in its spirit as downright destruction, is nevertheless 
little better in its results on the condition of those works of art: 
it is obvious that I have no time to argue the question out to-night, 
so I will only say this : 

That ancient buildings being both works of art and monu¬ 
ments of history must obviously be treated with great care and 
delicacy: that the imitative art of to-day is not, and cannot be the 
same thing as ancient art, and cannot replace it; and therefore if 
we super-impose this work on the old, we destroy it both as art 
and as a record of history; lastly that the natural weathering of 
the surface of a building is beautiful, and its loss disastrous. 

Now the restorers hold the exact contrary of all this: they 
think that any clever architect to-day can deal off-hand successfully 
with the ancient work ; that while all things else have changed 
about us since (say) the thirteenth century, art has not changed, 
and that our workmen can turn out work identical with that of 






















22 


the thirteenth century : and lastly that the weather-beaten surface 
of an ancient building is worthless, and to he got rid of wherever 
possible. 

You see the question is difficult to argue, because there seems 
to be no common grounds between the restorers and the anti¬ 
restorers : I appeal therefore to the public, and bid them note, that 
though our opinions may be wrong, the action we advise is not 
rash : let the question be shelved awhile : if, as we are always 
pressing on people, due care be taken of these monuments, so 
that they shall not fall into disrepair, they will be always there to 
‘ restore ’ whenever people think proper: \ say let the question be 
shelved, till art has so advanced among us, that we can deal 
authoritatively with it, till there is no longer any doubt about the 
matter. 

Surely these monuments of our art and history, which, 
whatever the lawyers may say, belong not to a coterie, or to a rich 
man here and there, hut to the nation at large, are worth this delay: 
surely the last relics of the life of the ‘ famous men and our fathers 
that begat us’ may justly claim of us the exercise of a little 
patience. 

It will give us trouble no doubt, all this care of our possess¬ 
ions : hut there is more trouble to come ; for I must now speak 
of something else, of possessions which should be common to all 
of us, of the green grass, and the leaves, and the waters, of the 
very light and air of heaven, which the Century of Commerce 
has been too busy to pay any heed to. And first let me remind 
you that I am supposing everyone here present professes to care 
about art. 

Well, there are some rich men among us whom we oddly enough 
call manufacturers, by which we mean capitalists who. pay other 
men to organize manufacturers; these gentlemen, many of whom 
buy pictures and profess to care about art, burn a deal of coal; 
there is an act in existence which was passed to prevent them some¬ 
times and in some places from pouring a dense cloud of smoke 















23 


over the world, and, to my thinking, a very lame and partial act 
it is : but nothing hinders these lovers of art from being a law to 
themselves, and making it a point of honour with them to 
minimize the smoke nuisance as far as their own works are 
concerned, and if they don’t do so, when mere money, and even 
a very little of that, is what it will cost them, I say that their love 
of art is a mere pretence : how can you care about the image of a 
landscape when you show by your deeds that you don’t care for 
the landscape itself? or what right have you to shut yourself up 
with beautiful form and colour when you make it impossible for 
other people to have any share in these things? 

Well, and as to the smoke act itself: I don’t know what heed 
you pay to it in Birmingham,* but I have seen myself what heed 
is paid to it in other places : Bradford for instance: though close 
by them at Saltaire they have an example which I should have 
thought might have shamed them ; for the huge chimney there 
which serves the acres of weaving and spinning sheds of Sir Titus 
Salt and his brothers is as guiltless of smoke as an ordinary kitchen 
chimney. Or Manchester : a gentleman of that city told me that 
the smoke-act was a mere dead letter there : well, they buy pictures 
in Manchester and profess to wish to further the arts ; hut you see 
it must be idle pretence as far as their rich men are concerned : 
they only want to talk about it, and have themselves talked of. 

I don’t know what you are doing about this matter here: but 
you must forgive my saying, that unless you are beginning to think 
of some way of dealing with it, you are not beginning yet to pave 
your way to success in the arts. 

Well, I have spoken of a huge nuisance, which is a type of 
the worst nuisances of what an ill-tempered man might be excused 
for calling the Century of Nuisances, rather than the Century of 
Commerce. I will now leave it to the consciences of the rich and 

*Since perhaps some people may read these words who are not of 
Birmingham, I ought to say that it was authoritatively explained at the 
meeting to which I addressed these words, that in Birmingham the law is 
strictly enforced. 














24 



influential among us, and speak of a minor nuisance which it is in 
the power of every one of us to abate, and which, small as it is, 
is so vexatious, that if I can prevail on a score of you to take heed 
to it by what I am saying, I shall think my evening’s work a good 
one. Sandwich-papers I mean — of course you laugh; but come 
now, don’t you, civilised as you are in Birmingham, leave them all 
about the Lickey hills and your public gardens and the like? If 
you don’t, I really scarcely know with what words to praise you. 
When we Londoners go to enjoy ourselves at Hampton Court, for 
instance, we take special care to let everybody know that we have 
had something to eat; so that the park just outside the gates, (and 
a beautiful place it is,) looks as if it had been snowing dirty paper. 
I really think you might promise me one and all who are here 
present to have done with this sluttish habit, which is the type of 
many another in its way, just as the smoke-nuisance is. I mean 
such things as scrawling one’s name on monuments, tearing down 
tree boughs and the like. 

I suppose ’tis early days in the revival of the arts to express 
one’s disgust at the daily increasing hideousness of the posters with 
which all our towns are daubed. Still we ought to be disgusted at 
such horrors, and I think make up our minds never to buy any of 
the articles so advertised. I can’t believe they can be worth much 
if they need all that shouting to sell them. 

Again, I must ask what do you do with the trees on a site that 
is going to be built over ? do you try to save them, to adapt your 
houses at all to them ? do you understand what treasures they are 
in a town or a suburb ? or what a relief they will be to the hideous 
dog-holes which (forgive me !) you are probably going to build in 
their places ? I ask this anxiously, and with grief in my soul, for 
in London and its suburbs we always begin by clearing a site till it 
is as bare as the pavement: I really think that almost anybody 
would have been shocked, if I could have shown him some of the 
trees that have been wantonly murdered in the suburb in which I live 
(Hammersmith to wit) amongst them some of those magnificent 




















*5 


cedars, lor w hich we along the river used to be famous once. 

Hut here again see how helpless those are who care about art 
or nature amidst the hurry of the Century of Commerce. 

1 ray do not forget, that anyone who cuts down a tree wantonly 
or carelessly, especially in a great town or its suburbs, need make 
no pretence of caring about art. 

W hat else can we do to help to educate ourselves and others 
in the path of art, to be on the road to attaining an Art made by 
the people and for the people as a joy to the maker and the user ? 

Why, having got to understand something of what art was, 
having got to look upon its ancient monuments as friends that can 
tell us something of times bygone, and whose faces we do not 
wish to alter, even though they he worn by time and grief: having 
got to spend money and trouble upon matters of decency, great 
and little; having made it clear that we really do care about 
nature even in the suburbs of a big town—having got so far, we 
shall begin to think of the houses in which we live. 

hor I must tell you that unless you are resolved to have good 
and rational architecture, it is, once again, useless your thinking 
about art at all. 

I have spoken of the popular arts, but they might all be 
summed up in that one word Architecture; they are all parts of 
that great whole * if w r e did not know' how to dye or to weave ; if 
w r e had neither gold, or silver, or silk, and no pigments to paint with, 
but half a dozen ochres and umbers, we might yet frame a worthy 
art that would lead to everything, if we had but timlier, stone, and 
lime, and a few cutting tools to make these common things not 
only shelter us from wind and weather, but also express the 
thoughts and aspirations that stir in us. 

Architecture would lead us to all the arts, as it did with earlier 
men : but if we despise it and take no note of how we are housed, 
the other arts will have a hard time of it indeed. 

Now I do not think the greatest of optimists would deny that, 
taking us one and all, we are at present housed in a perfectly 














shameful way, and since the greatest part of us have to live in 
houses already built for us, it must he admitted that it is rather 
hard to know what to do, beyond waiting till they tumble about 
our ears. 

Only we must not lay the fault upon the builders as some 
people seem inclined to do : they are our very humble servants, 
and will build what we ask for: remember, that rich men are not 
obliged to live in ugly houses, and yet you see they do; which the 
builders may be well excused for taking as a sign of what is 
wanted. 

Well, the point is we must do what we can, and make people 
understand what we want them to do for us, by letting them see 
what we do for ourselves. 

Hitherto, judging us by that standard, the builders may well 
say, that we want the pretence of a thing rather than the thing 
itself; that we want a show of petty luxury if we are unrich, a show 
of insulting stupidity if we are rich : and they are quite clear that 
as a rule we want to get something that shall look as if it cost twice 
as much as it really did. 

You cannot have Architecture on those terms : simplicity and 
solidity are the very first requisites of it: just think if it is not so: 
How we please ourselves with an old building by thinking of all the 
generations of men that have passed through it ! do we not remem¬ 
ber how it has received their joy, and borne their sorrow, and not 
even their folly has left sourness upon it ? it still looks as kind to us, 
as it did to them. And the converse of this we ought to feel when we 
look at a newly-built house if it were as it should be : we should feel a 
pleasure in thinking how he who had built it had left a piece of his 
soul behind him to greet the new-comers one after another long and 
long after he was gone :—but what sentiment can an ordinary 
modern house move in us, or what thought—save a hope that 
we may speedily forget its base ugliness ? 

But if you ask me how we are to pay for this solidity and extra 
expense, that seems to me a reasonable question; for you must 



















27 


dismiss at once as a delusion the hope that has been sometimes 
cherished, that you can have a building which is a work of art, and 
is, therefore, above all things properly built, at the same price as a 
building which only pretends to be this: never forget when people 
talk about cheap art in general, by the way,' that all art costs time, 
trouble and thought, and that money is only a counter to represent 
these things. 

However I must try to answer the question I have supposed 
put, how are we to pay for decent houses ? 

It seems to me that by a great piece of good luck the way to 
pay for them, is by doing that which alone can produce popular 
art among us : living a simple life I mean. Once more I say that 
the greatest foe to art is luxury, art cannot live in its atmosphere. 

When you hear of the luxuries of the ancients, you must 
remember that they were not like our luxuries, they were rather 
indulgence in pieces of extravagant folly than what we to-day call 
luxury; which perhaps you would rather call comfort: well, I 
accept the word, and say that a Greek or Roman of the luxurious 
time would stare astonished could he be brought back again and 
shown the comforts of a well-to-do middle-class house. 

But some, I know, think that the attainment of these very 
comforts is what makes the difference between civilisation and 
uncivilisation, that they are the essence of civilisation. Is it so 
indeed ? Farewell my hope then I had thought that civilisation 
meant the attainment of peace and order, of good-will between 
man and man, of the love of truth, and the hatred of injustice, 
and by consequence the attainment of the good life that these 
things breed, a life free from craven fear, but full of incident: that 
was what I thought it meant, not more stuffed chairs and more 
cushions, and more carpets and gas, and more dainty meat and 
drink—and therewithal more and sharper differences between class 
and class. 

If that be what it is, I wish I were well out of it, and living in 
a tent in the Persian desert, or a turf hut on the Iceland hill-side. 















28 



But however it be, and I think my view is the true view, I tell you 
that art abhors that side of civilisation, she cannot breathe in the 
houses that lie under its slavery. 

Believe me if we want art to begin at home, as it must, we 
must clear our houses of troublesome superfluities that are for ever 
in our way; conventional comforts that are no real comforts, and 
do but make work for servants and doctors : if you want a golden 
rule that will fit everybody, this is it: 

4 Have nothing in your houses that you do not know to be 
useful , or believe to be beautiful 9 

And if we apply that rule strictly, we shall in the first place 
show the builders and such-like servants of the public what we 
really want, we shall create a demand for real art, as the phrase 
goes; and in the second place, we shall surely have more money 
to pay for decent houses. 

Perhaps it will not try your patience too much if I lay before 
you my idea of the fittings necessary to the sitting-room of a healthy 
person : a room, I mean, in which he would not have to cook in 
much, or sleep in generally, or do any very litter-making manual 
work. First a book-case with a great many books in it: next a table 
that will keep steady when you write or work at it: then several 
chairs that you can move, and a bench that you can sit or lie upon : 
next a cupboard with drawers : next, unless either the book-case or 
the cupboard be very beautiful with painting or carving, you will 
want pictures or engravings, such as you can afford, only not 
stopgaps, but real works of art, on the wall; or else the wall 
itself must be ornamented with some beautiful and restful pattern : 
we shall also want a vase or two to put flowers in, which latter you 
must have sometimes, especially if you live in a town. 'Then there 
will 1 &gt;e the fire-place of course, which in our climate is bound to he 
the chief object in the room. 

That is all we shall want, especially if the floor be good ; if it 
be not, as, by the way, in a modern house it is pretty certain not to 
be, I admit that a small carpet which can be bundled out of the 






















2 9 


room in two minutes will he useful, and we must also take care 
that it is beautiful, or it will annoy us terribly. 

Now unless we are musical, and need a piano, in which case, 
as far as beauty is concerned, we are in a bad way, that is quite all 
we want: and we can add very little to these necessaries without 
troubling ourselves, and hindering our work, our thought, and our 
rest. 

At the least these things ought not to cost much ; and they 
are so few, that those that could afford to have them at all, could 
afford to spend some trouble to get them fitting and beautiful: and 
all those who care about art ought to take great trouble to do so, 
and to take care that there be no sham art amongst them, nothing 
that it has degraded a man to make or sell. And I feel sure, that 
if all who care about art were to take this pains, it would make 
a great impression upon the public. 

1 his simplicity you may make as costly as you please or can, 
on the other hand : you may hang your walls with tapestry instead 
of whitewash or paper ; or you may cover them with mosaic, or 
have them frescoed by a gieat painter: all this is not luxury, if it 
be done for beauty’s sake, and not for show : it does not break our 
golden rule : have nothing in your houses which you do not know 
to he useful or he!iere to be beautiful. 

All artjstarts from this simplicity ; and the higher the art rises, 
the greate r the simplicity. I have been speaking of the fittings of 
a dwelling-house ; a place in which we eat and drink, and pass 
familiar hours; but when you come to places which people want 
to make more specially beautiful because of the solemnity or 
dignity of their uses, they will be simpler still, and have little in 
them save the bare walls made as beautiful as may be. St. Mark’s 
at Venice has very little furniture in it, much less than most Roman 
Catholic churches : its lovely and stately mother St. Sophia of 
Constantinople had less still, even when it was a Christian Church 
but we need not go either to Venice or Stamboul to take note of 
that: go into one of our own mighty Gothic naves (do any of you 





















30 


remember the first time you did so ?) and note how the huge free 
space satisfies and elevates you, even now when window and wall 
are stripped of ornament: then think of the meaning of simplicity, 
and absence of encumbering gew-gaws. 

Now after all, for us who are learning art, it is not far to seek 
what is the surest way to further it: that which most breeds art is 
art: every piece of work that we do which is well done, is so much 
help to the cause; every piece of pretence and half-heartedness is 
so much hurt to it: most of you who take to the practice of art 
can find out in no very long time whether you have any gifts for it 
or not: if you have not, throw the thing up, or you will have a 
wretched time of it yourself, and will he damaging the cause by 
laborious pretence : but if you have gifts of any kind you are happy 
indeed beyond most men ; for your pleasure is always with you, 
nor can you be intemperate in the enjoyment of it, and as you use 
it, it does not lessen, but grows : if you are by chance weary of it 
at night, you get up in the morning eager for it; or if perhaps in 
the morning it seem folly to you for a while, yet presently, when 
your hand has been moving a little in its wonted way, fresh hope 
has sprung up beneath it and you are happy again. While others 
are getting through the day like plants thrust into the earth, which 
cannot turn this way or that but as the wind blows them, you know 
what you want, and your will is on the alert to find it, and you, 
whatever happens, whether it be joy or grief, are at least alive. 

-Now when I spoke to you last year, after I had sat down I 
was half afraid that I had on some points said too much, that I had 
spoken too bitterly in my eagerness; that a rash word might have 
discouraged some of you : I was very far from meaning that: what 
I wanted to do, what I want to do to-night is to put definitely 
before you a cause for which to strive. 

That cause is the Democracy of Art, the enobling of daily 
and common work, which will one day put hope and pleasure in 
the place of fear and pain, as the forces which move men to 
labour and keep the world a-going. 

















3i 


If I have enlisted anyone in that cause, rash as my words 
may ha\e been, or feeble as they may have been, they have done 
more good than harm; nor do I believe that any words of mine 
can discourage any who have joined that cause or are ready to do 
so . their way is too clear before them for that, and everyone of us 
can help the cause whether he be great or little. 

I know indeed that men, wearied by the pettiness of the 
details of the strife, their patience tried by hope deferred, will at 
whiles, excusably enough, turn back in their hearts to other days, 
when, if the issues were not clearer, the means of trying them 
were simpler ; when, so stirring were the times, one mignt even 
have atoned for many a blunder and backsliding by visibly 
dying for the cause: to have breasted the Spanish pikes at 
Leyden, to have drawn sword with Oliver : that may well seem to 
us at times amidst the tangles of to-day a happy fate : for a man to 
be able to say, I have lived like a fool, but now I will cast away 
fooling for an hour, and die like a man there is something in that 
certainly : and yet ’tis clear that few men can be so lucky as to die 
for a cause, without having first of all lived for it. And as this is 
the most that can be asked from the greatest man that follows a 
cause, so it is the least that can be taken from the smallest. 

So to us who have a Cause at heart, our highest ambition and 
our simplest duty are one and the same thing: for the most part we 
shall be too busy doing the work that lies ready to our hands, to let 
impatience for visibly great progress vex us much ; but surely since 
we are servants of a Cause, hope must be ever with us, and some¬ 
times perhaps it will so quicken our vision that it will out-run the 
slow lapse of time, and show us the victorious days when millions 
of those who now sit in darkness will be enlightened by an Art 
made by the people and for the people , a joy to the maker and the 
user .
