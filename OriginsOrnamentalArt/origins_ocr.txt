meant to represent according to some standard or another certain
facts of external nature.

What then is this body of art which is something different from
what we nowadays call pictures and sculpture?

It is the art of the people: the art produced by the daily labour
of all kinds of men for the daily use of all kinds of men: surely
therefore we may at the outset suppose that it is of importance to
the race of man, since on all sides it surrounds our life and our
work.

What is the end and aim of human labour? Is it not first the
continuance, and next the elevation of the human race? If there-
fore it has gone astray at any time from its due aim, and no one
surely will be so rash as to say that it never has, it has erred in
turning its force to the production of things which are not useful
_ either for the continuance or the elevation of the race of man.

___ Let us consider then what things human labour produces for
the service of the world. Broadly speaking they may be divided

into two kinds first those which serve the needs of the body, and
second those which serve the needs of the mind: such things as

food, raiment, and shelter, and the tools for obtaining these on

_ the one hand, and on the other, poetry, music, the stored-up

: knowledge of the fashion of the universe which we call science

and of the deeds of men on the earth which we call history, and

also the pictured representations of that history however

_ wrought.

__ These two kinds of productions, between them make up the
Wealth of the world; the things that are made to satisfy the
necessities of a healthy body and a healthy mind.

| But furthermore the wealth made for the service of the body

an again definitely be divided into those things which perish at
nce in the using, as food and fuel and the like, and those which

‘4te made to last some time and serve our needs day after day or

pear after year, as raiment and houses and so forth,

_ Here then you see between the rude arts, whose end is the

1 Production of mere food and raw material, and the exalted arts
v hich should satisfy the cravings of our minds, lies a mass a

Wealth-producing labour of a special character, which is that side

human labour to which I wish specially to draw your attention

mental art is no very important subject, and that it is

great matter what its origins were: but I hope to show

before I have done that it is a subject of very great importa
and that it is well worth while to consider what its origins wet
since it may lead us to finding out what its aims are, or should b
which in its turn may lead us to thinking of matters of t
deepest importance. 4
First of all I must say that though the phrase is genera
accepted it is not a good or descriptive one; for all art should”
ornamental, and when it is not ornamental, and in the degr
which it is not, it fails of a part of its purpose: however, t

tonight; this labour is called in what I should almost venture to ~
name our modern jargon the Industrial Arts. 7

Now all the things produced by these arts or crafts might be q
made without any reference to anything but their first obvious —
use: the house might have been just so many walls and so much |
roof: so much stone and timber, uncarved, unmoulded, un- 4
painted (except for weather-defense); the cup might have taken —
the first? convenient form it would from the potter’s hand; the
cloth might have remained undyed, unfigured, and in all this”
men’s bodies would have felt no lack; while their minds would —
have been free to exercise themselves with music and poetry and —
pictured images of the past, or with the gathering of the knowl.
edge of what is and what has been. j

But men would not have it so; from the very first they hav
striven to make their household and personal goods beautiful
well as useful; the rudest savage no sooner learns how to mak
anything than he learns also how to ornament it: before t
earliest dawn of history this instinct for ornament existed a
clearly as it did in the palmy days of Italian art: as you knoy
implements exist of men who dwelt in Europe ages before any
the races we name now, on which were carved, with no little skill,
the forms of the beasts of the forests they wandered in, and in
which life must have been so hard and beset with so many
dangers that we may well wonder that they had time or courage
to think about art: so divine a thing is the spark of hum n
intelligence. a

What does all this mean? why did they do it and take all this
trouble? Who taught them? id

Indeed their teacher is not far to seek: whatever lived or grey
about them: nay the mountains, the rocks themselves, the ‘bo ne
of the earth’ as the Northmen called them, had something abo u
them which they must have dimly known for beauty; the thi ng
which were useful to them for food and fuel and clothes wer
ornamented: the day and the night, sunrise and sunset wh c
showed to their dim minds as beings of passions like themselves
the serpent whose lurking malice and swift wrath they fearec

and whom they worshipped lest he should slay them: all these
had been fashioned fair and lovely by forces of which they knew
nothing: and they, the latest-born and maybe the most terrible
force of nature, how could they choose but take up the links of
the chain and work as nature worked about them: many things
she compelled them to, and this also.

This then was the birth of popular or ornamental art, the birth
of man’s intelligence.

Now the works of art I have just been alluding to belong to
times of whose history they alone give us any glimpse, and we
can have but a faint idea of anything that might have gone on
between those days and the dawn of history, the dawn of civiliza-
tion: of that dawn itself we know but little indeed, yet are toa
certain extent helped out by the consideration of the various
backward peoples of our time, some of whom at least one cannot
help thinking might have had a chance of developing gradually
into a condition somewhat like our past civilization if it had been
their doom to be born into the world at a time when civilization
has taken the form which it has now; the commercial form, under
which all Society rests on a gigantic system of usury, pitiless and
implacable, which is prepared to crush out of existence all peo-
ples and communities that cannot speedily adapt themselves to
its laws.

However that may be we can learn something from these
survivals, if so they be, from the earlier condition of the world
joined to the few historical hints we have left of that earlier

. condition, of the dawn of history: the lesson they teach us as to

the growth of popular art seems to me to be something like this:
the period is that of a state of things when Society has begun,
when every man has had to give up some of his individuality for
the sake of the advancement of the whole community: in that
Community division of labour has begun, though there is none of
_ scarcely any—in each occupation: a man has no longer to

e his own provider in everything; the strong and young fare
afield to hunt or fish, or herd the beasts of the community, or dig

_ and sow and harvest in the strip of communal tillage, while the
_ Weak, the women, and the cripples stay at home to labour at the

loom or the wheel, or the stithy. So far at least has the division of

labour gone. Now, rough as the hunter's life may be, he will have |
his joys however fierce and rude in his contention with wind and ~
weather, his stealthy watching and final victory over the quarry: ”
and the herdsman and tiller, although he has to take his share of
rough torment from storm and frost and sun, yet has his eyes on ~
beautiful things forever, and his ears often delighted by the
multitudinous voice of nature as he goes to and fro through the ©
changes of the year, nursing his hope of the harvest which is to”
be. With all such men, hunters, fishers, herdsmen, and husband-_
men, it was well, and still may be, if they are not oppressed, but
are allowed to have their due share of the goods which they have
toiled to produce. 4
But how did it fare with their brethren, who sat within doors :
paled by the lack of sun, down-hearted from want of air, with no
excitement or promise of victory to stir their blood; surrounded
by the blunders, the clumsiness, and the squalor of man instez d
of the order, deftness, and beauty of nature: hard indeed it seems
it must be for them to forego all the brisk life and stir while they
sit bowed over the loom and every minute’s work is like that o
every other minute, no change or hope but in finishing the
that they may begin another; or to keep for ever moulding the
pot of ugly grey or brown clay, no one of which is better or worse
than another (unless it be quite spoiled): or to have no ain
before them as they begrime themselves in the stithy but to mak
a knife that will cut like everybody else’s knife: it is hard the
they should be unwilling martyrs to the comfort of the common
wealth while others were leading a merry life, that they alon
should miss the glory of the tales of perils and daring by flo 0
and field, or the shouts [of] laughter that welcome the happy en
of the vintage or the harvest. Their case surely must be that the
are the slaves of slaves and as they sit at their dull tasks what ¢a
they hope for save the night and sleep in which to dream thi
they have grown strong and warlike, and the masters of suc
as they are in their waking hours? 4
Nay it was not so bad as that: whatever burdens folly an
tyranny laid upon mankind in those rough times, this burden '
dull and wasteful labour, unrelieved by any thought of

might be good in the work itself; unrelieved by any hope of
praise for the special excellence of the work, was not laid on the
craftsman for many ages, except in the quasi-penal labour which
was laid on hostile conquered tribes under the ancient civiliza-
tions of Egypt and Mesopotamia; for the most part very different
was the tale from the full one I have been telling of: labour found
out a solace and a glory for the handicraftsman from the earliest
times.

For note, that the goods which the hunter and the husbandman
conquered from nature mostly perished in the using, unless they
were of the kind that demanded more labour on them to make
them useful to man: the hunter despoiled nature of the goods she
had already produced; the husbandman helped her or compelled
her to yield more than she was willing to yield unhelped or
uncompelled; but neither of them created anything and their
gettings were consumed in the using, and the fame of them and
joy in them died with them: but the craftsman by his labour
fashioned something which without him would not have existed
at all, and which was destined to last many years, nay for genera-
tions even: so that there needed to be no haste nor hurry in his
work; he had time to think as he wrought at it, and to what

should he entrust his thought for keeping and for communicating
to other men rather than to the work which was growing beneath
his hands, the thing he was making of whose life he was absolute
_ MInaster: where then was the dullness now? The flowers of the
forest might glow in his web and its beast move over it: his
- maginings of the tales of the priests and poets might be pictured
_ 0n the dish or the pot he was fashioning; the sword hilt, the roof
_ beam were no longer dead’ bronze and wood, but part of his soul
_ Made alive forever: and now no day was like another to him:
hope was with him when he left his work in the evening that he

might mend the day’s failure or carry on its success the next day:

°pe wooed him to his work in the morning and helped him

through the day’s weariness.

And with all this he was grown to be no longer a slave of slaves,

ee

but a master; a man looked upon as better and more useful than
the hunter or the tiller of the soil, deserving of plentiful thanks —
from the community. 4
And these thanks, the glory for his creations were indeed often —
his on strange terms, for the type of craftsman was sometimes —
exalted to the rank of a god swaying the terrible forces of nature; ~
forging the bolts of the world ruler, fashioning the furniture of —
the house of heaven; building the rampart which was to guard for —
ages the holy city of the younger Gods against the frost and fire
giants of the North: but again and not without some countenance
even from these older myths (note the lame and crafty Hephaes
tus)* the type falls to the half-malignant and altogether guileful
mountain spirit, conquering rather by cunning than force th R
huge giant and mighty warrior and still fully possessing the gift .
of miraculous power and creation.*
Of course I do not mean to say that the primary intention was
to make these craftsman-gods types of labour; Hephaestus, Thor,
and Weland® had no doubt a wider and simpler origin than that
but they received the special characteristics of the literary my
from ideas of handicraft and craftsmen that had been long in
men’s minds. od
Such then it seems to me was the first origin of ornament on
wares: not merely an attempt to escape from the wearisomeness
of labour, but rather an expression of pleasure in the hope and
sense of power and usefulness which men felt in the making of
things in the childhood of the world.
Now it has been said, and surely with truth, that those men a
the best and usefullest who never altogether throw off th
childlike qualities even when they are grown old: and that same
maxim I would apply to the race of man as well as to the

  
   
  
    
    
   
  

 

* Morris probably drew much of his knowledge of Hephaestus, the Greek god ¢
fire and patron of handicraftsmen, from the many allusions to him in Hom
Iliad. In Feb., 1886, Morris was reading this work with a view to doing a full
translation, as he was then engaged in doing for The Odyssey (see Letters, P.
248). a

of Sigurd the Volsung (Collected Works, XII, 61-180). a

individuals composing it; and if it were good that it should be so
in other matters, and that the mirth and simplicity of earlier ages
of the world should yet leave some reflection on our leisure, still
more I think it is important that it should be preserved in our
working time.

Nor indeed did that pleasure of labour fail man for many ages:
I admit indeed that for a long time in the ancient world it was
limited and indeed oppressed by the sternness of hieratic art; as
notably for many centuries in Egypt, where the marvellous natu-
ralism of its earlier days, in some branches at least, fell under the
yoke of a stiff though far from ignoble conventionalism: but even
in that period we have enough left us outside the more pompous
ornamentation of temples and tombs to show that on many sides
art was still free, and labour abundantly illuminated by fancy and
invention: much the same may be said of that art which was
passed on through the whole of the valleys of Tigris and Eu-
phrates and even extended to Cyprus and other of the islands by
the people or peoples of Babylonia, and of which happy accident
has preserved so many specimens in ruin mounds of Assyria: the
pleasure of the artists who wrought the bas-reliefs for Assur-
bani-pal at Koycinjik is too obvious [in] the shapes of animals at

least [for] it to need many words from me here.’

The freer peoples who formed what was then the northern and
western hem of civilization were as a matter of course less Op-
pressed in their art by hieratic conventionalism, though they
were not, nor indeed needed to be, wholly free from it: under the

- classical peoples of antiquity popular art had to run another

danger of slavery, which in truth it did not wholly escape.

In popular art the expression of man’s thoughts by his hand
does for the most part fall far short of thoughts themselves; and
this always the more as the race is nobler and the thought more
exalted; in short all the more as the art, as popular art, is more

worth having, as there is more hope of continued life and prog: fi
ress in it: I mean that between the rough, speedily-penciled wor.
on a piece of archaic Greek pottery, or the shorthand for a field o
flowers of the Persian weaver, or the rough stone-cutting, half-pa- ©
thetic, half-humorous, of the mediaeval mason, between these ©
things and the highly finished and, in its way, perfect ingenuity y
of a piece of Japanese drawing or lacquer, there is a whole worl
of difference, the real worth being on the side of the clumsie
expression of the historic workman. i

Now for a long while among the Greek and kindred peoples
art was wholly in the condition of its thought being far greate
than its expression, deft and graceful (as amongst early art) tha
expression was: then came a period when the technical excel
lence (of the truest kind) advanced with wonderful speed; the
standard of excellence in expression grew very high, and the
feeling of a people cultivated very highly within narrow lim
began to forbid any attempt at expression of thought which did
not approach within the limits prescribed something like perfee=
tion: no man must attempt to do anything which he cannot do i
such a way that it is almost impossible to pick a hole in its
technical qualities: thus art was in the palmy days of the classi¢
times divided strictly into a great expressive art practiced only by
those who had mastered the means of expression, and a ver}
limited ornamental art which was but an adjunct to the highet
kind and in which there was nothing to express but complet
submission to certain limited and well-known rules of proportion:
such a state of things among a less gifted people would have gon
far towards destroying art altogether; but among the Greeks thi
aristocracy of art was so numerous as to give us an impression 4
this distance of time of a great popular art existing among them
and doubtless the rules of art must have been unconsciously $
well understood among the population, that what is called nowa
days bad taste did not exist among them at all; a condition of at
the easier to be brought about because of the great simplicity ¢
the life they led in which what we now call luxury made no pat

Nevertheless you must understand that perfect as their art Ne

which was mere chattel slavery: when all is said what a mass of
expression of human thought, what a world of beauty that exclu-
siveness shut out from the light of day. Absolute perfection in art
is a vain hope; the day will never come when the hand of man
can thoroughly express the best of the thoughts of man.’ Why
then should we deprive ourselves therefore of all the fancy and
imagination that lies in the aim of so many men of lesser capacity
than that of great masters? Is it not better to say to all who have
any genuine gifts however small, ‘courage! it is enough for a work
of art if it show real skill of hand, genuine instinct for beauty, and
some touch of originality; cooperation will show you how your
smaller gifts may be used along with the greater ones.’

Well the aristocratic exclusiveness of Greek art drew on it a
heavy revenge enough: I have spoken of its first period during
which the worth of its thought outwent its power of expression,
and of its second, when the expression having reached a point
approaching perfection, the exuberance of thought in it had to be
repressed to satisfy the exclusive fastidiousness of the Greek
mind: there remains yet a third period during which capacity of
expression having reached its highest point could go no further,
and when there was comparatively little to express by this per-
fected means, and the classical art was become academical and in
fact all but dead.

By this time all domination had long passed away from the
Greek name, and the Roman tax gatherer ruled the world of
civilization; after a while more by the terror of the name of Rome
than by any real power in the state: lower and lower fell the art
which the Romans adopted from the Greeks, till at last it was
redeemed from contempt only by the splendour, massiveness,
and honest building of its great architectural and engineering
works. In the meanwhile the great change drew near: the Roman
landlords had turned all the people of civilization into their
agricultural slaves, their hired servants and parasites, and the

proletariat of the great cities who were fed on their bounty
before the operation was quite complete the state of things s
brought about seemed likely to last for ever: for where was th

foe to overturn it? But by the time it was complete the foe was at

hand ready for its destruction: for the Roman had reckone
without his host: he had subdued all civilization and made it h

private slave; and now he found that whatever was respectabl ei
and desired the preservation of society would not fight; wheres S

whatever was against him and the stability of society, the stary-
ing slaves, the Christians, the barbarians of the East and
North were valiant and aggressive and were ready at every point
to push forward what he considered anarchy and the disruption
of the world, but which was at the worst the Medea’s caldron
from which a new and vigorous Europe was to be born again
with that new birth of society, and faithfully following every
stage of its fruitful death and change, a new art also was born:
this art was at first clad in the body of the effete art which it tool
the place of; but yet was from the first startlingly different from i
in soul and intention: as time went on it borrowed elements fron
the East and the North, and drew them together and mouldet
them into the Greco-Roman mass which was already revivifi
and little by little the classical wrappings fell off from it, and
clear the strange and beautiful body of Byzantine art, the art «
early Europe—of the time when feudality was shaping itself frox
the chaos of the ruins of old Rome. 4
From that city of New Rome it spread far and wide varying ¢
first but little except as the materials in which it was wrougl
influenced it by their fineness or rudeness: in Sicily, Egypt, Spait
Persia it was modified by distinct eastern elements, all of them
seems referable to that art of the East which was carried wit
about by the Arabs but was by no means Arab in origin bi
Persian rather: this influence abode with it and afterwards Q
acted strongly on the art of central and northern Europe whie
was born more directly of old or New Rome. q
In the extreme North and Northwest of Europe it met
another modifying element in the shape of the Celtic or mo

between this art, the representative of primitive ornamentation,
and the elaborate fretwork of Eastern art there is a certain sort of
relationship; so that it might be doubted whether the complete
ornament of the Middle-Ages does not owe some of its forms to
this probably pre-Aryan art of Europe: but I think in fact that
except in Scandinavia in the modified form above-mentioned its
influence on Mediaeval art was not abiding, the equally elaborate
but more logical and measured forms of the East taking its place.

However this may be it is certain that the great and in the main
homogeneous art of the Middle Ages was both in form and in
spirit a simple and direct development of the new-born art which
sprang from the corrupt though still beautiful remains of Greco-
Roman art; and it is to my mind certain also that it owed the form
of that new birth to the incoming of Eastern or Persian ideas and
handiwork which acted on it in a way not easy to trace I admit:
that mingled art as I have said was still more permeated in some
parts by the Eastern element, and in that condition in the 12th
century especially was very powerful in fashioning Mediaeval art
into what it presently became: nevertheless I cannot help recog-
nizing a certain fitness about the name Gothic for indicating the
work of the Middle Ages, though at first it may seem an absurd
misnomer born of the hasty glance the antiquaries of our grand-

fathers’ time took of an art which they despised and were igno-

rant of.’ For besides that the Goths were as it were the iron of the
spear that slew the Roman Empire, and from the most righteous
slaying sprang Gothic Art; there is obvious in it, nay the very soul

Of it is that spirit of the North which makes us what we are at the

best: the wild imagination, the love of nature, the scorn of pedan-

_ try, and stilted pompousness; the genuine, unashamed sentiment,

homely and familiar things; a courage in short which is not

anxious to thrust anything which is human out of sight even in
the most solemn times and places: these are the characteristics of

Gothic art which pierce to the very heart of all those who are '
capable of feeling that manly love of man and his fair earthly
home which is of all things that which most makes life worth
living.

And now understand that that which makes Gothic art all
is its freedom: it was above all things the art of the people; the a
of cooperation: no craftsman, who is a real one, is despised in it;
there is room for every mind and every hand that belongs to a
real man: something to express and some means of expressing it
are all that is asked for: all the time this art lasts no handicra t
lacks beauty for a moment, nor is anyone set to dull and slavish
toil: things grow beautiful under the workman’s hands without
effort it would seem, and men do not know how to make an ugly
thing: nowadays when we light on a piece of the household
goods of this period we pay vast sums of money for it and
treasure it up in a museum; for it teaches us—us who know
everything else, this rough piece of handiwork done by an artisar
who thought that the world was like a flat dish and that the v
went round the rim of it. 4

If this seems strange to you, let me remind you of one kind o
work wrought by these craftsmen, which is both more accessi
ble and more impressive than their moveable household goods:
mean the buildings which are [our] forefathers’ and among som
of which it is your rare good fortune to live: a good fortune whie
I hope will leave its impress in many an hour of sweet, indestrut
tible pleasure on the future lives of every one of you. A

Indeed they have had a hard time of it those ancient build
of England raised once in such hope by the ‘Famous men and th
fathers that begat us’: pious and religious people battered am
half destroyed them; not understanding that the spirit whic
raised them was the essence of all religions: those who fought x
our liberties blindly looked upon them as the strongholds ¢

middle of the classical period, despised them, botched them,
degraded them: the pedant of today, self-sufficient, the slave of
money, ignorant he also of that real history which is no dead
thing, but the living bond of the hopes of the past, the present,
and the future, believes that from his study or his office he can
re-create past times, and without a word of sympathy or a day of
education can get from the machine-driven workman of today
work like that of the free craftsmaster of the Middle Ages: he
while I speak is still busy in destroying the last remnants of our
fathers’ handicraft, and maybe he is the last as he is certainly the
worst enemy they have had.

Yes even such a storm of folly and greed has swept continually
over these glorious works into which was once builded the ve
soul of England: yet in spite of it all there they stand yet a token
of the hope that was, and yet shall be of the freedom and honour
of labour. Bare as they have been stripped, wounded and
patched up as they have been can we even think of them without
being moved at the energy of co-operative art which reared them
in a rude age by the hands of a scanty population?

For I say that glorious as they are in themselves they do
betoken something more glorious still: for remember they do but
represent the kind of building which was used throughout the
country: when your chapel rose in its splendour there was not a
cottage or a shed even on the way between Windsor and London
which did not share in its beauty, humble as it might be. Now
think what this means; we are so used to houses being generally
ugly that it is difficult to imagine, every house for instance in
London or the suburbs more or less beautiful; not a chandler’s

' shop at Hammersmith or Brixton but what was a work of art:
| there would be education for you: education which no books

Could give; amusement and happiness, to the builders as well as

And I must tell you that if we have not this it is because we do

Not desire it: when we do desire it, and are ready to sacrifice
Steed and injustice for it we shall have this also as well as justice
and goodwill between man and man.

dawn of popular art: centuries we cannot count lie between the
day when the cave-abider scratched his drawing of a mammoth
on a mammoth’s bone, and the day when the English masons and
wood-carvers struck the last stroke before the Reformation at St,
George’s Chapel yonder.* During all those ages whenever we
catch a glimpse of the life of the people we find the popular arts
progressive on the whole, and seldom failing in their first aim of
lightening the toil of man by giving him pleasure in his daily
work, i

A long lapse of years indeed, while from the time when Si

not at all by their minds: they work at it not knowing what they
do; like all other toilers nowadays their work is a grievous burden
to them which they would cast off if they could. We cannot help
knowing that not another hour’s work would be done on the
Decorative Arts today if it were not that the workers feared death
by starvation if they left their work.

I hope you do not suppose that on these terms of labour you
can have an art which has any life in it: if you do you are
dreaming and will have rude awakening some day: meantime
you well know what vast sums of money rich people will spend to
isolate themselves from the tokens of increasing population, from
the hovels in short which are being raised with such frightful
speed all over civilized countries; and I do not wonder; if I were
tich I should do the same myself; I should try to escape from the
consequences of the system which had made me rich.

For when it comes to explaining why the labour on which
depends the well-being of the arts or in other words the pleasure
of life is in its present condition of slavishness I must tell you that
since the 15th century a great change has taken place in the social
condition of the people at large, which some people ignore, and
which more still are contented with as a positive gain, and which
they believe has brought the world of civilization into a social

state which will endure as long as the world itself.

It would be impossible within the limits of such a lecture as

_ this to show by what gradual means this change took place; to

show how the chattel slavery of the classical times melted into

_.the serfdom of the early Feudal period; how from those serfs
arere gradually developed the burgesses or corporations of the
: mediaeval towns, the yeomen and labourers of the fields, and the
eed of the guilds, which classes together with the feudal
: s formed the society of the later Middle Ages: it will be
a for our present purpose to state that throughout the

eudal lord and his inferior that distinction was rather arbitrary

an real; that difficult, and except by means of ecclesiastical

same virtue: at the same time although in the later middle ag
this hierarchical system had reached the inside of the cr
guilds, and the craftsmen were divided into the privileged m
ters, with their privileged apprentices, and the journeymen who
were unprivileged, there was no division of labour inside the
ilds save that which arose from the learning of the craft: every
full-instructed workman was master of his whole craft.

Neither outside the guilds was there any violent competition
buying and selling: the greater part of the goods made by
craftsmen were made for home consumption, and only the ov
plus of this came into the market: it was necessary therefore
the very existence of the craftsman that he should be skillfu
intelligent, and thoughtful; nor was he driven by the exigencie:
of the competitive market which might demand cheapness fr

it may be allowed that he was politically oppressed, superstitiour
and ignorant—but he was an artist or free workman, using hi
brains for the pleasure and the solace of his working hours.

Passing over the gradual process which has changed him
what he was in the 15th century to what he is today let us lo
the contrast of his position then and now, and glance at the sta
of Society which has produced it.

into one distinction, that between rich and poor, or gentle
and non-gentleman: there is no insuperable bar to prevent

generations the offspring of the person who has climbed up that
ladder between rich and poor may become the equal of the

eatest families of the Feudal aristocracy, most of whom, to say
the truth have very slender pretentions to representing the fami-
lies whose titles they bear: moreover there is felt to be no differ-
ence in cultivation and refinement between the titled gentry and
the rich capitalists or their hangers-on of the professional classes:
they are all gentlemen together, even when the latter are scarcely
as well-to-do as some of the best-off of the lower classes.

On the other hand there is the great class of working men,
among whom there is certainly great diversity as regards their
wages, some of them as aforesaid earning as much as or more
than when they are at work the poorer gentlemen; but whatever
their grades may be as regards their money fortune they are all
non-gentlemen, and do differ really and not conventionally from
the class of gentlemen: their education, their leisure, their refine-
ment, their religion is weighed in a different balance from [that]
of the gentleman, nay they do not even speak the same dialect of
the mother-tongue as he does: they are in all respects the lower
classes, really and not conventionally I say, so that a working man
is not fit company for a gentleman, or a gentleman for a working

man.

Now this class division of the 19th century as opposed to that
of the 14th was brought about by the gradual development of the
system of commerce which is now complete or nearly so; the
system as I said of unlimited licence of competition which sup-

planted the mediaeval system under which life was regulated by

a conception of the duties men owed to each other and to the

unseen powers.

I will not tonight give you any direct opinion as to the opera-

tion on other sides of life of these two systems, but I am com-
Pelled by my subject to state to you that the effect of this change
on popular or decorative art has been to destroy it.

between civilized and uncivilized people living in the same state

most of men: or in other words that the great mass of people

Fortunately, you see, as far as the arts go that cannot be; it is a
question of art and the happiness of the worker, or lack of art and
his unhappiness.

too well, men do the work of machines, and machines of men—
both disastrously. q
4th those who are to produce beauty must live amidst beaut
their homes and surroundings must be clean, orderly, and in
word beautiful: this should be no hard matter to accomplish:
since the whole world is beautiful save where man has made it
ugly. a
oath all men should be educated, and have their due share in
the stored-up knowledge of the world, so vastly greater now than
in the days of art, but so much more unequally shared. All men I
say should be educated not down to their ‘station in life’
people call it, that is according to the amount of money the
parents may have, but according to their capacity. a
6th when all these claims are allowed and acted on the las
claim I make for labour will come of itself: that is, that ther
should be an end of class distinctions: that is to say that all cr:
should be honourable and honoured, and that every man sho
be able to rise to eminence and fame by the exercise of his ow.
craft, the work he understands best; whereas at present he ca
only rise to eminence by deserting his craft, by taking an un
share of the wealth of the world as wages for doing lighter wor
than his fellows; by becoming a capitalist as the phrase goes.
I will now sum up these conditions briefly: 1st extinction ¢
poverty; 2nd leisure; 8rd avoidance of wasteful work; 4th car
the beauty of the earth; 5th education according to capacity,
6th abolition of class distinctions, real, mind you, not formal.
To my mind these are the conditions of life for working men, |
really for all men, under which we can have in these days om
more popular art, or a happy life for most men. Is it worth whi
to strive to bring about this happy life? If it be, can we say th
the price to be paid for it can be too high, whatever it may be?
You will have understood if you have followed my statement’
the due conditions of labour that in my belief that price is
reconstruction of Society; for no mere palliatives of the evils
the present system will bring about those conditions. Furth
more I admit that such a great change would involve the sacrifi
from many of us of things now much cherished: yet as I belie

rounds of self-interest do so rather from stupidity than malice,
so I think that their loss, or punishment, if you will, will be rather
imaginary [than]* real when the change comes: I think what we
shall chiefly have to sacrifice will be the encumbrances, the
troubles, the sorrows even which we now cherish as part of our
wealth.

As to the means by which the Reconstruction is to be brought
about, I must for more than one reason say nothing of them
tonight; save this: that you yourselves in one way or other will as
time goes on have offered to you opportunities of helping forward
or of hindering that reconstruction; times when you will have to
choose between the right hand and the left, and to range your-
selves for or against the progress of the race of man: such chances
are solemn times in the history of every man and it behooves us
when we meet them to choose not influenced by our apparent
self-interest but by our real sense of right and wrong: you may
think that but a truism; yet I must tell you that in such matters it
is the commonest thing to be said to anyone who thinks he ought
to join some movement for the bettering of his fellows, ‘what
will you do if this change happens’: to my mind it is manhood
and not rashness to answer such an objection by saying, what
shall I do? Why have my fair share like my fellows.

I believe the time is at hand when each one of us of the
well-to-do and rich classes will have to choose whether he will
strive to have the great mass of men his equals and friends, or to
keep them down as his slaves: when that time comes may we all
temember this, that wretched and shameful as is the condition of
a slave, there is one condition more wretched and shameful

_ still—that of slave-holder.
