THE POLITICAL OUTLOOK

“Peruaps some of our friends may be surprised ata Social-
ist whom they may be disposed to look upon asa purist hav-
ing anything to say about politics at all, and indeed it must
be admitted from the first that politics of any kind are no
very pleasant study, since they chiefly mean a record of the
crudest blunders and follies of mankind, so that it is not to
be wondered at if many men of good feeling, and who are
deeply impressed with the evils of our daily life and would
sacrifice much to do away with them, do nevertheless
shrink from politics: it is not strange that such people
should say, Letus teach people what toaimat, try to educate
them, form opinion that is, and then stand by and see what
will happen. That's all very well, and I am far from saying
that such men are not useful; but after all what will happen

Why when opinion becomes strong enough, that is, be-
comes the opinion of many people, it must strive to get itself
carried out in action: as long as there is discontent with the
present state of things there will be hope of altering it. That
hope can only be realized by the combined action of those
who are moved by it, who as soon as they are so combined
with a view to action, and are determined that they will by
some means or other get people in general to accept their
opinion, must become a political party whatever they may
call themselves; and when they have reached this point they
are and must be in spite of all disclaimers hostile to all par-
ties who are obstacles to the furtherance of their opinions.
As far as their opinions are concerned the world is com-
posed of friends of their party and enemies to it: he who is
not with us is against us: they are at war in short. They
may carry on the war feebly or stoutly, well-manneredly or

277

 
ill-manneredly, implacably or forgivingly, but it is warno
less as long as they are a party. Such war, like all wars, i
itself an evil; or at least there go with it such turmoil:
miseries, disappointments, such traps for the unwary in
morals and honour on all sides, that it is hard to separate
its beneficent essence from its evil accidents. Yet forall that
those who hold strong opinions and who shrink from it
must have some doubts of the value of those opinions or else
are overmastered by very natural timidity or love of ease? |
don’t blame them for that, but I do rather blame them for
putting forward their timidity and love of ease as standards
for others to followas they not seldom do: itis weakness not
strength in them that they dare not enter into the war
necessary for the realization of their hopes. Let them at least
stand aside lest they become mere obstacles and enemies of
the very opinions which they hold.

“People therefore who hold strong and definite opinions
‘on the relations of men to each other must either belong to,
some political party or be cowards: I say there are questions
of the day that press so strongly on thinking men for solu-
tion that they can only be evaded by cowardice: neither can
Lallow that some of men’s dealings can be wholly separated
from others so as to escape the sweep of the net political:
strong opinions on religion, ethics, economy, science nay
‘even art and literature (as I myself have found) will at last
bring us face to face with the question “what is true so-
ciety?” If we answer that question rightly and acceptall the
consequences which flow from that answer we are free in
mind at least whatever compulsion may do to our bodies, if
‘we answer it wrongly we are slaves: nor less slaves if we
evade it, however proud we may be of our superior educa-
tion, intelligenceand refinement.

“Therefore it seemstome that we Socialists must be:
tical in the sense in which I have been using the

of fact it means the same: whichis
Mee ieee load ess eee
word has been so terribly misused in these days, and so in
278

  

 

 

 

  
political language at least has come to mean pretty much
the same thing as cowardly or ev

“We of the Socialist League have fully expressed the fact,
that we consider ourselves political by calling ourselves
Revolutionary Socialists: it is quite clear if you come to
think oft that since we condemn not only the obvious evils
‘of modern Society, butalso the ethics and economy of which
they are the result, we must have a practical and political
aim in view: we cannot be content to sink into a mere philo-
sophical society enunciating opinions which some people
may accept if they will without altering their daily relations
with other people: if our opinions are to be accepted they
will alter the relations of men altogether, nobody will be
able (or willing) to stand out of the society which they will
form...

‘Itis quite necessary for us to face the position and see
what we really are, because there are on the one hand so-
called Socialists who are not revolutionary or political atall,
and on the other some who are political but with whose
policy we cannot agree. The frst are represented by various
experiments in association, for instance communities some
of which are founded on absolute conditions of equality as
amongst themselves, but do not pretend to meddle with
society at large: as for these it seems to me they are des
tined either to failure and extinction after having played
their part of experiments of association more or less valu-
able; or else if they can live long enough to meet the active
revolutionary period they will gradually melt into the
genes ee ee ee

bits of association and of the practice of equality which
their experiments will engender: in any case except as a
Bice clarence tecparevaiecicn
‘because of their standing aloof from politics as I have been
using the word. Apart from that function of betokening the
great ‘our enemy in the present state of things can
afford to them because he does not fear them,
since they have renounced the contest.

 

 

 

 

279
‘On theother side are those who would be political froma
false point of view: they would mix with the political parties
of the day whose aim is not the destruction of our slave so-
Giety, but its continuance, and would ally themselves as
opportunity serves with one or the other band of those who
are their direct enemies in the hope that those enemies can
be cajoled or frightened into doing the Socialist’s work and
not the Bourgeois’s: I shall have some more to say of this
view further on, so at present I will only remark that this
kind of policy is what is commonly but I think erroneously
meant by political Socialism, and I think it is a mistake in
tactics altogether. When they have got as far as they can the
enemy will still be the enemy and will have to be met direct-
ly and in face, and they will have to begin again on the road
which the Revolutionary Socialists have been following
steadily all the time.

“Butthough wehave nothing to do to mix ourselves up in
the parliamentary squabble, and though to many worthy

le that degraded and degrading twaddle-shop called
Barhament means nothing at al, it would be a mistake not
towatch the signs of the times in all directions.”

 

 

 

 

He then enumerates the types of people who look to
Parliament as a means of change, while there are those who
watch the change to democracy with apprehension like
Frederic Harrison in his New Year's speech:

‘Anyhowheismuch put out and the other evening he no
longer talked about the coming triumph of democracy but
asserted that it had really taken place; and to him that de-
‘mocracy seemed very much of a tyranny, and to be dreaded.
accordingly. I must say no wonder, for the Positivists hav-
ing a righteous dislike to the more commercial aristocracy

‘the time, have nothing to putin its place except the spec-
tre of righteousness definitely drawn indeed, but quite
imaginary, which may be born they hope some thousand

hence.

280
‘Well, what Mr Harrison, adisinterested man and of real
goodwill towards the people, fears in a not unreasonable
manner if his blindness could be taken for a standard of
fact, if what he fears were all that could come between the
present muddle of things and the orderly hierarchy of rea-
lized Positivism, what he fears in this way there is many a
‘man fears in other ways, for the most part thinking that life
will be rougher and harder for those who now live refined
and delicate lives, that they will have to work more when
the final triumph of Democracy comes.”

 

The lecturer picks up the thread again and observes you

have ‘different kinds of minds all of them looking on par-

liamentary matters with various degrees of attention, some

fearing it, some hoping from it, nay almost worshipping it.”
‘He goes on to describe them as follows:

‘First thereis the great body of uninstructed people such
of them as are well enough off to have time to think about
politics at all, who by hereditary habit have got to expect
that “government” can do something for them, and who
Oe ort ll pein re at
conscious yet of the terror which that improvement has
carried into the souls of their masters; perhaps because
they are quite conscious that they are stil needy and havea
hard time of it, and that former political improvements
have not helped them much. Yet when they get to know
what real politics mean their enlightenment may be both
sudden and complete.

“Then comes the group of the intellectual ari i
pessimists mostly who fear for their position, prematurely
perhaps but certainly not without reason if a of
culture and refinement is what they wish to preserve, and I
ee

‘Lastly there is the (a bi who have not id
out that there is any Sete ee eee
positon of culture and superine morality: to these optim-

281

  
ists the world is good because they know nothing of it but
their own drawing-rooms; as they get enlightened they
join the ranks of the timid pessimists, and learn to feara new
foe, the people grown bold enough like Oliver Twist to ask
for more.

“What has happened to give these ideas to those groups of
hopers, fearers, and self-complacent people? Democracy
has developed, as surely every thinking person expected it
to do, but it has not developed in the direction it was ex-
pected to: I don’t think it is misrepresenting the views of
advanced politicians of, say, twenty years ago, to say that
their hope in democracy was that without levelling all dis-
tinctions of rank or talent it would turn the whole of the
decent working-class into small bourgeois, leaving outside
a fringe of the vicious idle incapable, or in a word the un-
lucky; of whom I am afraid those advanced ones took no
account atall; did not even think of taking the pains to pro-
videa sufficiency of gallows for them.”

 

 

 

 

He points out that these ideas, these ideals have fallen,
through: ‘the paradise of the little Bourgeoisie is vanishing
like the desert mirage, and showing us the hard realities of
depression of trade and over production, the tokens of the
commercial system nearing the end which unlimited com-
petition and the growing aggregation of eapital are prepar-
ing forit.”

 

‘Then speaking rather hopefully of the better instruction,
of the working class and the widening of knowledge, he ob-
serves: ‘Meantime historical ce has been grow-

ing, and basely as the men of culture do often use their gifts
an knowlege, yt the things themselves ae good and
fave opened the door to manya lif giving truth, History
which was once little more than a string of doubtful tales of
the bloody wars and unaccountable follies of kings and

scoundrels in which the was
taken for granted, has now Sorte keel Oona teens
282

 
at least in part, and to show us the ceaseless struggle of the “
people to be free.”

‘The lecture contains an interesting passage which shows
Morris's thoughts on the forming of the
out of the break-up of old traditions, a subject to
had devoted an article in Commoncceal the previous year, in
which he says: ‘True, there is as yet no solid party, but I
repeat there is one forming, which I believe will be the
strongest which our times have seen, and by whatever name
it may be called, it will be the party of reaction grown con-
scious that firm and serious resistance must be made to the
claims of labour for equal rights for all.”

‘He is talking of the sham of political freedom and the
‘new idea that is pushing out the old Bourgeois ideal’ and
continues:

‘The openly seen result of thisamong our political parties
is the break up of old party ties and distinctions, joined to
a retention of the old names: the ground is covered by the
same troops under the same banners, but the cause of
quarrel is different: There is a Tory party still in England
which would doubtless be Tory in action ifit could be, but
that is quite hopeless for it, so itis obliged to clothe itself
in Whig principles as the most reactionary vestments
‘which can be worn without tumbling off in hopeless rags:
there is a Liberal party also; but it includes the nominal
Whigs but little changed from their old estate, and now
openly the exponents of that older radical ideal which 1
sake of before the tea of che sanctity of property and

attempts.t state Socialism, which are either so insignificant
or so impossible to work that they are called practical; and
thereis besides whole host of betwixt and between people.
“This [is] what has become of the old Conservative and.
Liberal arrangement of parties. At first sight it seems
very complicated state of things but it is really much sim-
pler than it looks, or at least will result before long in a
simple condition of matters political. As far as Parliament
iad ts execultve joes that ie tsa as power Ostet ecaee
tent goes, the real power is the Whig party: a great portion
of the Tory party gravitates towards them; almost all the
foating mass betwee the Whigs and Teaticale veally
belongs to them: every Radical who loses faith in demo-
cracy of who is stared by the advance of Socialism, of is
growing old and cynical is bound to swell their ranks. Nor
are they doubtful as to their course of action in trying to
ealize the Bourgeois ideal. They are prepared to accept
Giiry chamge you lessc tual’ sacscly political Valea
covertly as possible but also as stiffly, every attempt to-
wards economical freedom : they will not involve the coun-
try in war if they can help it, unless the enemy is helpless
and his purse worth having; but they must have ‘new
markets if it is possible to get them with the help of our
present commercial bodyguard: but chit and aboeallt
is their business to spread the middle-class, to give the more
energetic part of the working-classes every opportunity for
bettering themselves so long as that can be done at the ex-
pense of the working-classes themselves, as they neither

“This great party therefore, the party of Moderation, is
284

 

 

  
‘our one real enemy: what are their chances of success? I
have just named their supports, in other words they are,
commercial success amongst the rich, ignorance and dis.
union among the workers. But the forces against them are
amongst their own camp: their own necessities will over-
throw them: capital is their master not their servant: and its
very organization, so powerful against revolt while all goes
well, will prevent that spreading of the middle-classes w
is essential to the life of the Moderate Party, thatis to say
to the existence of Modern Society. The tendency of ali
modern production is not towards spreading abroad and
dividing, but towards gathering up into bigger and bigger
heaps; and the terrible King Competition will sternly for-
bid any artificial reaction from this tendency. Nor after all
can the workers be kept quite ignorant; once more the ne-
cessities of the capitalists have forced them to instruct the
workers more or less, and instruction breeds education.
Furthermore these Moderates have dangerous allies who
lay {no the bands of progress by tying to suppress i
openly: I mean the great reactionary party on the conti-
nent. You English working-men when you hear the bour-
{geois as you often will holding forth on the extent to which
the revolutionary violence on the continent has hindered
the cause of progress, throw the lie back in his teeth. What
all that means is the efforts of workers not so corrupted by
‘commercialism as we are to sustain their freedom against
direct open monstrous attacks on it. And much as we sym-
pathize with the sufferings of those individuals who have
‘been crushed by this open brutality, most fortunate itis for
‘us and for the world that tyranny has taken that form in
‘countries not so commercial as ours; because it has given
the cause an army of men who feel their common ee
and aspirations uniting them against tyranny of all kit
whether the tyrant be oe ee:
philanthropist's frock-coat. I say that the Moderate Party
cannot help allying themselves with the Immoderate Party
and so hastening the education of the workers.

 

 

 

 

285
“And mind youthe lapse of time and the course of events
may or probably must force them out of their Moderation.
Iris their cue at present to give nearly full license to all ex-
pression of opinion, which I think we Socialists shall be wise
toavail ourselves of while we may. Forsuppose that opinion
to be very widely spread and at the same time to have no
Parliamentary outlet, no privileged place to be heard in
while itis obviously Subversive of the holiness of modern
Society, it will be looked upon as immediately dangerous,
and will be treated (only more decidedly) all over the
British Islands as it has already been treated in Ireland, that
is, asa police and prison matter.

“People may say, Well ifthey do this they will beno long-
era Moderate Party. That is true; they will not attempt
using the high hand until their failure is obvious. It is the
destiny of the Moderate Party to turn into confessed re-
actionaries, but of course when they do so the Revolution
will not be coming, but come.

“To sumup. The old parties who between them held the
state in their hands and governed in the exclusive interest
of the rich classes are broken up. In their place is a political
muddle which is in process of resolving itself into two par-
ties, one sustaining, the other attacking society founded on
wage slavery. There will of course in Parliament be an in-
terval during which this will be by no means clear, and
Parliament-like poverty will make strange bedfellows.
‘When it becomes clear and the people know at last that the
liberty which denies, as a monstrous demand, their rightto
the full reward of their labour, isa sham, when that happens
itwill be found that Parliament was not made for the people
and that the struggle will be outsideit.”

 

 

 

 

“The lecture concludes with an impressive picture:

‘Thus I have tried to show you what our enemies are,

Changed indeed they are in outward aspect from what the

‘enemies and tyrants of the workers once were, as I have
286
seen their images many a time, carved by their own slaves;
sitting solemnly in their high places, their half-drawn
swordslaid across their knees, their haughty but eager faces
looking into the life of personal energy and contention
which were its chief elements. All that is changed now. In
no cathedral of the future will the effigies of our present
rulers make fair and fitting architectural ornaments: the
sword is laid aside and the unseen compulsion of famine has
taken its place. The natural mask of hypocrisy cultivated so
highly that it does not know itself has supplanted the war-
elm; our masters of to-day will not confess the desire of
i strong man to enjoy life at anyone’s expense; nay they
seem almost to have lost all energy, all sense [of] pleasure in
their practice of their one necessary virtue,andrule us as if
they themselves were dead, their bodies only haunted by
the terrible power of capital which has made themand us,
which has made the hideous sham peace that is, and the
stern reality of the strife which is to be.

“Yet dull as they are, vacant as their lives are, changed
as they are inal respects from those lords of the old violent
and eager life, their aim is one with theirs: they must live
on the labour of others or the reason for their existence is

fone. To live like masters is their aim. Nor should our aim
e other than mere contradiction to theirs, which embraces
the intention of making us live like machines.

‘On their success herein all their political hope is found-
ed; and sometimes in moments of depression one thinks
they may succeed; one fears then that the world may be-
come nothing but Bourgeois and machines: yet in mo-
Bt ste nls ear dctecniped ec
‘men, come what will, we shall foil that monstrous attempt
and save the world from that terrible doom—hope always
‘then and work always.”
