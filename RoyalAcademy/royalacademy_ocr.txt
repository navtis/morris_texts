THE EXHIBITION OF THE ROYAL ACADEMY
(By a Rare Visrror)
From To-Day, July 1884.

‘'T has been noticed that those who seldom go to the

theatre are more critical and exacting than regular play-

goers, to whom their modicum of that mild excitement
hhas become necessary by force of habit; this is doubtless a
kind provision of nature which would seem to have ordained
that those who must be amused should not suffer reo much
from their amusement; so they go, and laugh and cry at the
right places; or at any rate sit out placidly such entertain-
ment as is offered them, gravely comparing one nonentity,
with another, balancing their respective merits and de-
merits without much consciousness of any Standard of dra-
‘matic excellence outside the twaddle they are used to.

‘On the other hand, those who seldom go carry with them
some hope of receiving special pleasure from what th
think should be a work of art, and if the entertainment falls
short of that, they are not ashamed to confess their disap-
pointment, and so perhaps run the risk of being considered
ill-natured and exaéting persons,

‘That risk I am now prepared to run; for though there

225
may not beso many people who find it necessary to frequent
exhibitions and studios without caring for the petures (of
ten without looking at them), as there are who are bound to,
sit through plays night after night without being interested
in them, still there is a considerable body of such unfortu-
nates. And itwould even seem to have allterature ofits own,
in the press, the cri n which literature seem to feel
bound to make the best of a bad job, whatever happens, a3
regards those artists to whom the public has got used, and
concerning whose works it has learned certain catch words;
while on the other hand, some other artists who have the
luck (good or ill ait may be thought to trouble the public
mind by the possession of genius, ae fighthard enough
to win a place in this too good-natured criticism—a place
usually several degrees lower, if that matter, than that of
‘men immeasurably their inferiors.

With this levelling criticism I, though a Socialist, have
no sympathy, and yet I do not se how the exes en do
otherwise, as far at least as the good-natured part, the indis-
ccriminate praise, goes; for the general opinion is that the
fine-arts are in a flourishing and progressive condition, and
thisimpression the criticsare bound to share, therefore they.
must make their facts square in detail with this confident
mood, and if they are wrong, ‘so much the worse for the
faéts.”

admit indeed that there are some (but a few) who have
misgivings as to the value of modern art; but these for the
‘most part believe that any short-coming therein is acciden-
tal, and may be mended by the individual efforts of a few
men of geniusand charaéter now alive, who by some means
‘or other will be able to forma living school in the midst of a
population ignorant and careless of art,

tis to these doubters that I really address what follows,
which is written not in thewantonness of one who wishes to
relieve his mind by the expression of unusual opinions
‘couched in étrong terms, but with the hope of
into them some of the hope which I feel for the future,
amidst all the disguét and disappointment of the present.

In fulfilling my task of giving my impressions of the chief
pitture exhibition of the year, it will be necessary for me to
mention the works of some artists in high favour with the
public in an unconventional manner. I must ask most of
these at least to consider, in case they read these lines (which
is improbable), that unless I respected their talents, their
‘works would be useless to me as illustrations of principles;
since the piétures of an incapable dauber or so can prove
nothing but his own individual incapacity, while misdireét-
ed Best may show us the error of the ways of art collec-
tively.

Now in considering such an exhibition as that of the
Royal Academy as an indication of the present State and
tendencies of art, itis surely necessary to have a clear idea of
what the aims of a painter should be. Something like this,
I think, embrace them all: 1t. The embodiment in
art of some vision which has forced itself on the artist's
brain, and. The creation of some lovely combination of
colour and form. 3rd. Thesetting forth afaithful portraiture
of some beautiful, characteristic, or historical place, or of
some living person worthy to be so portrayed; in either
case 80 as to be easily recognisable by a careless observer,
and yet to have a reserve of more intimate facts for a careful
one. 4th. Mastery over material; the production of a fin-
ished and workmanlike piece, as perfeét in all ways as the
kind of work admits of.

‘Ormore briefly: 1st. Expression of imagination. 2nd. De-
corative beauty. 3rd. Realization of Nature. 4th. Skill of
execution.

Success in any of the three first of these aims, ragerher
sith tha lad, wl give a pidture exdtence a a work of art.
‘Mo&t pictures that impress us seriously have achieved suc-
cess in more than one of the three joined to the 4th, while

st works of art have all the four qualities united, yet in

iue subordination to the master one of them, whichever it

may be, which produces the greatest impression on us; this,
ees ehatis mean by tierond ye

“These aims have been, unconsciously maybe, always be-

227

 

 

 

 
fore the artists of all living schools of art, and according to
the lights of their period were attained to by them. This is
agreed to by artists generally to-day, mere deficiencies re-
sulting from an archaic period not destroying the claim ofa
school to attention except with men quite ignorant of the
history of their art. The Standard of excellence, therefore,
by which we must judge the piétures of to-day would bead-
mitted by all thoughtful artists, who look with great and
genuine admiration on the painters of the end of the Middle
‘Ages and the Renaissance, and who one must think, since
they @udy them intensely, cannot fail to know what their
aims were; they must have found out that the pictures
which they admire so much and with such good reason do
mostly express imagination, always have decorative beauty
in them, show a real sympathy with nature, and never fail
in workmanlike executior

Let us therefore apply this standard of excellence to the
works in the present exhibition of the Royal Academy,
which though it is below the average of the past ten years,
is so simply because it lacks the one or two remarkable pic~
tures that other exhibitions have had: and again I say that
‘we must remember that our Standard is no mere ideal one,
but has been reached by many works, and approached at
least by almost every picture remaining to us of the time be-
fore the seventeenth century.

‘Skill of execution is the first thing we must seck for, si
without it « picture is incapable of expressing anything, is
a failure and not a piéture. Well, there are signs here and
there on the walls of the Academy of skill ofa certain kind,
but what does it amount to? does it give us any reasonable
hope of establishing by our present method of artistic life a
workmanlike tradiGonal kil, continuous and progressive,
so that while there may be hope for a man of genius for
pushing forward the standard of excellence, no one, be he
of genius or not, need waste half the energies of his life in
half-fruitless individual experiments, the results of which
he cannot pass onto others? What signs are thereof colee-

228

 

   

 

 

  
 

 

    

 
tive skill, the skill of the school, which nurses moderate 1
talent and sets genius free? Scanty signs indeed: at best a t
plausible appearance of workmanlike execution, alow kind
of skill which manages to get through the job, but in so
dull and joyless a way that one’s eye almost refuses to rest
upon the canvas, or one’s brain to take in any idea it may
Strive to express. That is all | fear that can claim to repre-
sent anything like traditional workmanlike skill. What
other skill of execution is visible, is chiefly, almost entirely,
an amateur-like cleverness, experimental, uncertain, never
successful in accomplishing a real work, in expressing a
faét or an imagination simply and étraightforwardly, but
often enough succeeding in thrusting itself forward and at-
tracting attention to itself'as something dashing, clever, and
useless; the end not the means.

Of this kind of skill there is a good deal; and to speak
plainly itis on this quality, such as tis, that most of the pic-
tures must rest their claim to attention.

For even the most obvious of the other qualities of our
@andard, realisation of nature, has been cultivated by the
painters, it seems to me, with but little enthusiasm. Mr
‘Alma-Tadema’s Romano-British Pottery, though unsuc-
‘cessfullasa whole, shows indeed delightand skill in painting
all the details of still-life, and in its flesh painting, especially
‘of the accessory figures, a great advance in realisation over
his former works: it is really quite refreshing to find an
artist among the exhibitors who cares about anything, and
tries conscientiously to realise it. So I thank Mr Tadema
heartily for his onions and mosaicand beautiful black ware:
nor, I feel, ought I to object to the very ‘British’ legs which
are walking upstairs, though I rather wish they would walk
away. The Interior of a Country Druggist’s by Mr Cheva-
lier Taylor, aname unknown tome, isa quite unpretentious
pidture which is considerately hung near the ceiling, but
‘which in spite of that can be seen to be effectively painted at
‘any rate, to be good colour and tone, and to contain excel-
lent portraiture of persons and things; amongst the pic-

229

   

 

 

 
tures of this year itis quite remarkable, and though it pre-
tends to nothing but prose, is more interesting even in sub-
ject than most of the figure pictures in the place.

I shall return to the landscape art presently, but must at
this point where we are considering realization, say a word
about Mr Peter Graham's pictures; for in spite ofall draw
backs they must be considered successes from that point of
views I shall have to speak of his Dawn again. Mr Brett
also spares no pains and labour and skill over his sea-pieces:
Kingsley’s young Alton Locke would have owed an extra
debt of gratitude to him if he had been painting in those
days; but with one exception to be noticed presently they
are not interesting in subject.

For the rest there is nothing to praise on this head. Mr
Luke Fildes’ work does I suppose lay claim to realistic
qualities, but can by no means support that claim: his pic-
tures show a contented resting in most common-place con-
ventionality except as regards minor pieces of till life, and
in the Venetian Flower Girl, a rough, and I must add re-

ulsive skill of representation of the mass of flowers, which
is by reason of slapdash execution and a peculiar deficiency
in sense of colour turned intoa piece of downright ugliness,
and. consequently has no raison d’étre whatever. For to

saint lowers and to miss the beauty of them is too great an
insult both to nature and art: especially ifit be so missed by
reason of hasty or insolently confident execution: a painter
whose forte lies in that direétion had better leave
alone. Itis now many years since Mr Milla has painted
flowers which have not injured his picturesinstead of adorn-
ing them. There are, by the bye, several pieces of this kind
of representation of Italian proletariat life scattered about
the gallery, which al seem to be founded on Mr Van Haan-
‘en's work, of which there is a specimen called Afternoon
Coffee, which I cannot say impresses me, in spite of the
artigt’s reputation. It certainly aims at an effect of realism,
‘which it by no meansattains to: the painting isin a way skil-
fal, but quite joyless and uninteresting; thereis no pleasure

230

  

 

 

 
  

  

   
in the colour, though it does not show the repulsive quali-
ties of Mr Fildes’ work: in short, there is nothing in it but,
a facility which is shared by Mr Fildes, and, amidstits pre
tence of truth to charaéter, a vulgarity of feling which

So much for the attempts at realisation, the most obvious
and commonplace of the painter's aims: we now come to
decorative beauty, oF let us say beauty simply as expressible
by form and colour. Lam sorry to say the task of speaking of
this quality is as easy a the good Norwegian merchant
found the subject of the ‘snakes in Iceland’: for in sober
truth there is not one single picture (nor has been for years)
which even aims at decorative beauty; except Mr Albert
Moore’s Reading Aloud; and of that I am bound, very
unwillingly, to say that it is not successful as a piece of de-
oration, and like Mr Moore’s work generally, of late at
least, is at once poor and weak in painting on the one hand,
and on the other so obtrusively proclaims contempt for all
intelleétual qualities, that in spite of the great talent of the
artis, itis almost a nullity.

Here then is a body of art which is careless of beauty or
incapable of producing it; a strange outcome of modern
‘culture,’ But do we fare any better when we come to the
moftintelleétual ofthe qualities of our tandard, expression
of imagination ? Scarcely if at all better; it is no exaggera-
tion to say that there is hardly a trace of it in the pictures
which pretend most to it, the figure piétures: and we have
to fall back on the choice of subject in landscape to discover
what feeble signs of imagination are left to our school of
painting to-day.

‘To begin then with those Jandscapes which show any
tokens of discrimination as to subject; [hope that Mr Peter
Graham's Dawn is a real portraiture and not ‘composed’
in any way, for apart from the skill and one may add the
feeling with which the aspeét of sky and earth are realised,
the subject cannot but move anyone who has visited the
northern latitudes. There isa sense about it of romanceand

gt

 

 

 

 

 
interest in life amid@ poverty and a narrow limit of aétion
and maybe of thought, which is characteristic of a poor but
historic country side, and reminds me of many a morning’s
awakening in a country which one may call the northern
limit of history as it is certainly one ofits richest treasure-
houses; Iceland to wit.

‘Another Scotch artigt, Mr David Murray, has a very in-
teresting picture of Loch Linnhe, drawn and painted with
‘much sympathy for the subjeét, although the refined paint-
ing is open to the charge of weakness; his other picture,
My Love has gone a Sailing, is not so interesting as the
subjeét, but well deserves the honour (if honour it be) of
being one ofthe piftures purchased by the Academy from
the funds of the Chantry Bequest; Mr Murray has strange
companions inthis doubtful honour, a we shall ee here-
after.

Grez sur Loing by Mr Stirling Dyce is hung too high
for the visitor to see the execution; but in its absolute grey-
ness, and in an indefinable charm of form possessed by the
ordinary trees, and the houses which are not &tritly speak-
ing architeétural or even pi€turesque, itis quitein sympathy
with that French landscape which some of us have learned
tolove.

‘Then there is Mr Brett’s most careful pi€ture of Mc-
Leod’s Maidens, for which all reasonable people owe him
deep gratitude; tis no lite thing for us ay-at-homes to
be able to see as in a glass these shores and skerries of the
Gael, which may before long be enlightened by new tales
and deeds of heroism, and become a holy land for us Social-
ists. Only Iwill ask Mr Brett to hold his hand a while from
mere wastes of sea and sky, and to paint portraits of places
Tike these McLeod's Maidens, hrangeandromanticin form
and bearing historical memories with them. I am not
ashamed for instance to remind him of what a mine lies un-
touched in Iceland; I could tell him of places there as wild
and Strange as the background of a fairy story, every rood
‘of which has a dramatic tale hanging by it;and scenes more-

232

  
  

 

 

 
over not unpaintable for a man like him, who mingles so
much patience and determination with his skill.

Nay, while lam on this subject, Iwill once more make an
appeal to our painters which Mr Ruskin made to them years
ago; the change of seasons and shift of weather we have al-
ways with us to give artists opportunities of painting sun-
rise, sunset, moonlight, autumn, spring, shower, mist, and
‘snowstorm; the mountains and rocks will last our time and
longer; but there is one thing which is passing away from
the world quicker and quicker every year, and that i fair
human building mingled with sweet and unspoiled coun-
try; we cannot have too many records of this before it is all

;one and it is much to be feared that it will all go before
Commercialism gives place to that reasonable life which
Socialists long for. It would surely be most desirable to have
records of the genuine works of our fathers, which were
raised before the supremacy of the present bourgeois bar-
barism, for the days when that barbarism shall have passed
away, But when we shall still be cumbered and hampered
by its material results; for the days when we shall be pa-
tiently getting rid of the blotches of filth and misery now
called towns which the barbarism has cursed us with. I do
not mean to say that we get none of this now; several Jand-
scape painters do some ofthis work, but intermittently and
without much enthusiasm. Mr Boyce of the Old Water
Colour Society indeed has done a great deal of it, and done
it too with skill and full sympathy with his subjects, and we
‘owe him all thanks for his good service; but surely many
might do it, and not landscape painters only, but also many
‘or most of those (who have sense enough) who at present
are driven into painting inane and ridiculous figure sub-
‘jeéts, which I don’t think they themselves can care about,
and which Lam sure no one else ougit to.

Jeu be understood, that Lam not speaking of mere
pieces of what is called picturesqueness, but of buildings
‘which, often unpretentious, are nevertheless real architec-
ture; and which are so beautiful and so fitted for their pait

233

   
uses at all events, that they often make what would other-
wise be a dull piece of country-side lovely and interesting ;
will not painters see to this? I am sure such works would
be saleable; indeed just as one of these old houses will make
a piece of Norfolk or Essex interesting, so also, and that is
much more of a miracle, will the careful portrait of one
make an Academy Exhibition interesting. Would it not be
worth while for our artiéts to form a Society for painting the
old houses of Englan will undertake that the Society
for the Proteétion of Ancient Buildings will help them to
subjeéts and so forth.

Such a scheme of work might do something to call the
attention of the public to the treasures which they are daily
losing without ever having known of them even; and pos-
sibly might shame some of the owners of them out of the
habits of careless brutality with which they usually deal
with the work of centuries, and which we, the public at
large, are fools enough to allow them to treat as their pri-
vate property.

Itwould be unfair after saying this not to notice the two
or three pictures exhibited this year in which portraiture of
‘old buildings has been attempted in an unambitious and
simple manne, leaving altogether alone such pieces of dull
conventionality as Mr Vicat Cole’s Bisham, which as they
are like nothing existing, or possible to exist, are clearly not
meant for portraits of places.

‘The original of An Old English Country Inn by Mr
H. H. Olivier I know the name of, though I have never
seen it. Itis the only fifteenth-century inn left in England a
far as I know, except the George at Glastonbury; I sup-

‘Mr Olivier has reasons for not naming it, so I will not
disoblige him by doing so; but would suggest to all artists
making portraits of places when they want to keep thename
dark, to add to their title, ‘a real place,’ or something of that

sort. This piéture is again hung up too high to be seen

perly, butseems to befusly well printed, -

Mr Eyre Crow has been good enough to give us the like-

ness of an interesting building in his school of the Aitre St
Maclou, Rouen; by the way itis now thirty years ago since
I first saw Rouen, then almost entirely a Medieval City and
more romantic and beautiful than words can say; I wonder
how many beautiful houses have been wantonly or com-
mercially destroyed in those thirty years leaving no record
behind them,

Mr Charles Stoney has painted a piece of Malmesbury
town, with its beautiful spire showing over the houses. If, as
seems probable, Mr Stoney has a real liking for this sort of
work, | can tell him of several places in the country lying
west of Oxford which would suit him, I think; only he
might paint some of them more minutely than he has done
with this piece of Malmesbury, as the detail of them and
the way their Stones have weathered is so delightful ; the sil-
very greyness of these western towns he has rendered well
in his Malmesbury Spire.

Mr Phene Spiers has a rather dull water colour of the
beautiful buildings at Stoke Say in Shropshire. Mr Newton
Bennet has a careful étudy of the Mill at Streatley also in
water colours, but this often-painted subjeét is scarcely
architeétural enough for a painstaking artiét as things go.

It is likely enough that I have missed several more un-
pretentious works of this sort among the ocean of Stupidity
that one has to wade through at the Academy. I beg the
painters of such works to pardon me for having missed
them,

Very reluétantly, before I make some general observa-
tions on the State of intellegtual art among us, I must speak
cof one or two crimes, for I can call them nothing short of
this, which disfigure the present exhibition.

‘The first of these is Mr Orchardson’s Mariage de Con-
venance, which is certainly clever enough to force the at-
tention of the passer by; but on what terms? The subject,
hich s surely trite enough to have been let lon, repule

may be said that it is dramatic, and itis, but again at what
an expense! ‘The drama is laid on with a trowel. Hogarth,
direét and blunt as he was, did not find it always necessary
in his very bourgeois moralizations to have figures acces-
sories, and all of the most hideous and degraded kind, But
once again, granted that it was necessary to make the luck-
Jess pair both man and wife in this picture attain to the very
height of repulsiveness, and that the black ugliness of the
surroundings was also necessary, was it essential that the
colouring and execution should be thoroughly repulsive
also? Again, Hogarth did not find it necessary to point his
morals by scrawling and daubing his background in, Does
the wretched colour help the drama really? Mere lamp-
light is not of such a horrible quality, even when a bour-
gevstragedicomedy is going on. The fattis Mr Orchard-
son was determined at any cost to attraét attention, and has
chosen to do so by heaping one ugliness on another, from
the laying on of the paint to the subject and its dramatic
treatment, and so has achieved his end indeed, but in doing
so has insulted artand produced a monstrosity.

Near this piéture, so worthless in its aim and so false in
its method, hangs another: a sorry sight indeed; the re-

bought and sold and thrown away: Mr Millais’ Id
subject of which, when we first heard of it, seemed
enough for a painter of whom it must be said at his best that
his treatment of a subjeét reconciles us to the subjedt itself.
But the first glimpse of the picture made an end of any
hopes the subjeét had given us. Itis true that the drummer
boy, both face and figure, does recall, not Mr Millais at his
bet, but yet Mr Millais as one yet hoped he might be; al-
though he has made not the slightest attempt to temper in~
to something tolerable the horrible red and yellow of an
English drummers coats wor to-day, though not if Mr
Millais knew it, in the Pretender’s time. But beyond this
one figure there is absolutely nothing in a biggish canvas;
the heads of the three Highland girls are mere caricatures of

236

 

 

 

 

 

   
 

 
the artist’s former work; the glen in which they are seated,
which the painter of Ophelia could, if he had pleased, have
made beautiful by merely painting a glen as it was without
selection, theglimpseof the royal army, thedrummer’scom-
panion, are so much meaningless scrabble, the very dram is
painted without pleasure: the canvasis filled up, and, since
it has Millais’ name on it, is now ready for market—that
is all. To judge Mr Millais by this picture one would sup-
pose heis now heartily sick of his art, regrets his past career,
and laments that he does not live a life of pure commer-
cialism.

‘So much for two individual crimesagainstart, thesecond
‘of which seems to me much the mos grievous, as it means
the loss of what might have been. The other crime I must
mention is a corporate one, and the criminal is the Royal
Academy itself. Ithas bought out of the funds of the Chan-
trey bequest a pidture called the Vigil, by Mr Pettie. In
common with most artiéts, I am curious to know why?
‘Will the half-dozen academicians who do know whata good

Gture really is inform the public what the merits of Mr
ettie’s piéture are? Will they deny that they do not know
that it is one of the worst pittures of a bad year? OF their
‘other purchases this year, no one I should think would ob-
{jeét to that of Mr David Murray's My Love has gone a
Sailing, mentioned before in this paper. But I must say the
third one, that of After Culloden, does not mend the mat-
ter much; it is commonplace and conventional to the last
degre, reminding one of sort of picture tamed out in the
early Viétorian days, and which the great Mr Fred. Bay-
ham used to blame sometimes or praise sometimes accord-
ing as they were the works of friend or foe, This is the sort
of thing which gets the Academy the bad name it has got,
snd makesit perhaps the molt contemptible public body in

England—which is saying much.
there are three piétures by foreigners of note in the
exhibition. Mr Van Haanan’s I have already noticed. La

a non-English piéture, and because I may have to meet the
possible objeétion that the faults I have been noticing in the
resent exhibition are due to its being'a colleftion of Eng
lish pictures.
the third pi@ture, by a foreigner, I think I should have
noticed in any case and added it to the list of crimes against
the arts I have been drawing attention to: this is M. Van
Beer's Soir d'Eté—a most detestable picture; careful and
smooth in execution, but with little merit even on that
ground save the capacity of laying on oil-paint minutely; a
Very token it seems of the lat corruption of the bourgeoisie,
a conscious pandering to the worst tastes of that part of it
which consciously preys upon others: it might well serve to
illustrate such a book as Gaboriau’s L’Argent d'Autrui.
Thave now mentioned all the pictures I could see worthy
of special praise or blame. Most of the public favourites are
thot noticeable enough to be mentioned it is searcely-worth
while to say that this or the other painter is duller than usual,
if he is always dull: and to say the truth this article is as
short asitis because there are so many who are always dull,

ture is an inexplicable accident, then I must say it seems to
sme that there is no hope for Art. Indeed, some of them will
say that there are painters outside the Academy of the high-
est genius, and ask, does not that fact redeem the Modern
School, and give us hope of its future? Hardly, I fear: these
artidts (there have been few better at any time) are ‘not un-
derstanded of the people’ atall;the public sometimes treats
them with open scorn, sometimes with indulgence, but al-
‘ways considers them mereeccentricities, Thereal favourites
of the public are painters whose pictures I could not even
consider in going through the Academy; while fully ad-
mitting the genius of those few men—I will not say how
few I think them—I see no hope of continuity in it; no
chance of their eStablishing that tradition which alone can
keep a great school of art alive, and educate the people to

the one hand, insolent or fatuous riches on the other? I will
he plain and say that with the one exception of Mr Millais,
‘who has now indeed turned his back upon himself, those
only among our painters do work worth considering, whose
minds have managed to leap back across the intervening,

across the waste of gathering commercialism, into the
Eanan they are flesped through and through

with the manner and ideas of the great Italian painters and
their forerunners, and it is through this alone that they are
able to produce their beautiful and, paradox as it may seem,
criginal works. Anyone who wants beauty to be produced at
the present day in any branch of the fine arts, I care not
what, must be always crying out ‘Look back! look back!"
Itis no use playing with the question: those who wish to
have art in these passing days must forget three hundred
years and go to school with the craftsmen and painters of
the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries; the alternative is toac-
ceptas art the useless cleverness of Mr Orchardson or Mr
Fildes, or the meretricious platitudes of M. Bouguereau;
and I say emphatically that this is not art,

Now Iaskagain, withall solemnity and with pain enough,
is it possible that a living school of art can be founded on
these fragments of retrospective art nursed by the brains of
‘one or two Strangely imaginative men? I can only answer
the question one way myself: it is impossible, ‘The art of
modern Europe, whose roots lie in the remotest past, un-
discoverable by any research, is doomed, and is passing
away; that isa serious, nay an awful thought; nor do I won-
der that all artiéts, even the most thoughtful, refuse to face
the fact. I cannot conceive of anyone who loves beauty, that
isto say, the crown of a full and noble life, being able to face
it, unless he has full faith in the religion of Socialism.

Tis in that faith that I have written the past pages; in
that faith that Look on the abvious corruption ofthe fine
arts going on faster and faster every year, ste} with
th gore Tnankruptcy of society not without gretcer-
tainly, yet with a certain exultation also, because I can feel
in it the coming of the new day, and even such a piece of
wretched twaddie as the exhibition we have just been con-
sidering is token ofthe coming change,

In what way the new art will come who can say for cer-
tain? Itseems to me that the ideas of the olderart till linger
too much in the minds of cultivated men to allow any ger
mination of the new amidé them. I believe, as I have

handicrafts: that the longings of simple people will take up
the chain where it fell rom the hands ofthe craft-gulds oF
the fifteenth century, and that the academical art which was
developed from that misreading of history which we call
the Renaissance, will prove a barren stem. However that
may be I know surely that the new society, which we hope
