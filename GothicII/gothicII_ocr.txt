 

THE GOTHIC REVIVAL [II]'

n my last lecture I gave you my ideas as [to] the origin of the
art of medieval Europe and the ways by which it spread
over the various countries; I told you what to my mind w
the spirit of the art, and pointed out how the change befell whi
brought it to an end, and supplanted it by an art which was
retrospective in spirit, and therefore narrow and cumbered with
pedantic pride: I showed how after a brief period of brillian
owing to the individual genius of those great men who we
given to the world at the beginning of the Renaissance perio
that Renaissance fell lower and lower till at the end of the 18th
century the arts of civilization were as far as beauty, inventio f
and imagination are concerned at a standstill: I concluded by
hinting at the rise of that revolt against pseudo-classical stupid=
ity, which took place as I think first in literature rather than in :J’

o

manual arts. i
This was necessarily the natural course since even the most
i)

individual and intellectual of the latter depends of necessity on
processes which are the result of tradition of some sort howev:

blind it may be; and this tradition is very difficult to shake off and
can scarcely be shaken off indeed in the lifetime of any one
person. However, the feeling for history and the attraction more
literary and sentimental than artistic and critical towards Gothic
art did show itself side by side with the revival of literary ro-
mance, though its results were at first feeble and even ridiculous
being little more than the perpetration of certain buildings in that
queer style of Carpenter’s Gothic of which one yet stumbles
across specimens now and then, amongst which however one
must stop to note the almost miraculous phenomenon of a painter
of that period who had a real and strange genius for the decora-
tive or beautiful side of the art, Blake to wit, who visionary as he
was understood not only the power of words in verse but also the
power of form and colour to delight the eye at the same time that
it exalts the mind. Of course the Carpenter’s Gothic aforesaid was
attempted long before anything approaching accurate knowledge
of the styles was current; it was the time when all round-arched
architecture was spoken of as Saxon, and all pointed lumped
together as florid; which distinction was in itself however a con-
siderable advance over the knowledge of the previous years,
which generally affected to speak of the architecture of seven or
eight centuries of European history by the not very inclusive or
explanatory name of monkish. However real and careful anti-
quaries soon got to work on the history of Gothic art when
Interest in it was once awakened, and Rickman at last discrimi-
nated the styles of English Gothic architecture with remarkable
clearness,” and from that time forward real knowledge of its

 details was gained: details by the way that appealed so little to
~ the understanding of the 18th century that it is not very long

befqre I.h'ckman’s time that the draughtsmen of architecture
could give any idea of the general appearance of a Gothic

building.

Now about the time when Gothic architecture began to be

‘ Somewhat understood, as if to give some countenance to the
queer name of “ecclesiastical” architecture by which the general

public used to know it until quite recently, there came as an ally
to the study of the arts the movement in the English Church
which has since got the name of ritualism, which I think on the 3
whole one may put down as a part of the general tendency to
protest against the blank stupidity of the 18th century, or if you =
will part of the general tendency towards mediaevalism: anyhow
by the time that this movement was well under way Gothic art
began to receive a great [deal] of attention, and to vindicate its
title to ecclesiastical art, or Christian Art as Pugin® with little
more logic used to call it, by getting itself used as an imitative
style for the building of churches everywhere at least in England:
till at last almost every church which was built had to be built in
this style such as it was; people not seeing as they don't alto- -
gether see even today the queer incongruity of building their
houses in one style and their churches in another. With this the -
first act of the Gothic revival looked at in its narrower sense may
be said to have ended: it triumphed as an exotic ecclesiastical 3
style; and by this time was fairly well understood in an archeo-
logical way by several of the leading architects. I must just
mention here to return to it afterwards one very luckless result of |
this alliance of quasi-art with quasi-theology: a mishap expressed !
by the word restoration, and which I am inclined to think we
might have partly at least escaped if one side of the newborn
interest in mediaeval history had not been dominated by theo
ogy: as it was the most frightful ravages were wrought by this
pest while yet people’s ideas about I won't say the essence, b
the mere differentia of Gothic were very crude indeed, and th
worst of it is that this enthusiasm for thoroughly mediaevalisi
in the theatrical way a building already mediaeval in reality h
formed a habit of restoration in the country clergy who for
most part have as yet not so much as heard that there is such
thing as popular art: a habit which the worthy guardians of our
national architectural antiquities would seem to exercise almost

unconsciously like the hebdomadal sermons, and by which they
lay into the hands of archeologically-minded architects, who
find it difficult to resist the temptation of beginning to tamper
with an ancient building: and when once they begin find that it is
very difficult to know where to stop. All which would be laugha-
ble indeed if it were not so woefully tragic: there is something
quite sickening to a lover of art to think that an ancient building,
a lovely piece of art in itself, the growth of the very soil of the
country; the outcome of many centuries of thought; the witness
of a state of society and methods of handicraft long passed away,
after having escaped so many dangers of change and violence
and accident and mere lapse of time should be liable to sudden,
wanton destruction brought on it by a whim arising in the head
of a half-educated man, who has not even grasped the fact that
the workmen of today are in a different position to those of the
Middle Ages: I say that it is sickening that this should be the case
and that the public should have no protection against the whim
of an individual and no appeal to anything else save his ignorance
and prejudice: as to the architects who are the other factor in this
bad business, it must be said of them, that while some are most
honourably distinguished both by their knowledge and their dis-
interestedness, it is a matter of course under the present unhappy
arrangement of society that the greater number should look upon
such schemes as business matters and treat them accordingly.
_ Well the first act of the Gothic Revival, brought us I say to
Imitation Gothic triumphant as an ecclesiastical style, to a fairly
accurate archeological-architectural knowledge of the construc-
tion and details of mediaeval building, and most unhappily to

- Testoration. In the next act the knowledge of the style has much

Increased, and it is even perceived that it is founded on princi-

‘ Fles, that there is a life and spirit in it: from which perception it
7 ollowed as a matter of course that those who knew anything

about it proclaimed its fitness not only for ecclesiastical buildings

b

ut for all buildings: this perception one may say in passing had
€en much helped about this time by the growing study of

.fOreign and kindred styles especially the architecture of Italy,

ofessor Ruskin’s unrivaled eloquence and wonderful ethical

Instinct leading the way in this branch of the study of art as in

 
78 The Unpublished Lectures of William Morris

many others.* It was a necessary consequence of this more inti- -
mate study of the spirit of Gothic art that men should find
themselves drawn specially towards its earlier periods: already in
the first act of the Revival archeologists had marked pretty -

clearly the periods of birth, growth, maturity, and decrepitude,
but it was not till this time when the subject was considered

scientifically almost, that they formed the hope of founding a new
style of architecture on the vigorous organic period of Gothic: the ]

The Gothic Revival 11 79

went with it had a real chance of a second new birth: several
talented architects quite broke with the mere pedantry of imita-
tion and set themselves seriously to build as a mediaeval builder
would have done with his principles and instinct if he had been a
member of our present society: it now became obvious that the
Middle Ages did not come to a sudden end in 1320 and that an
abundance of excellent works had been wrought as late as two
centuries after that: many good buildings were the result of this
closer study; buildings which if they had depended wholly on the

period when still bearing obvious traces of all the history which
had produced it, it looked forward ever to fresh progress and -
continuous change into something still more desirable, the period
of its greatest hope when it looked forward confidently from past -

architects’ design and superintendence would have been of very '
great excellence. I may also be allowed to mention that some time |

 

struggles to future perfection. ‘
Once again even from this reasonable study of the best and

most characteristic epoch of an art came in the hands of feeble

and illogical people confused by their little knowledge fresh
misfortune for us in the shape of the foe Restoration: for many of
the newly-made-wise archeologist-architects in their enthusiasm
for purity of style, could see nothing worth attention or preserva-
tion in the works of the ages that followed the period of purity;
genuine though they were and instinct with the history and
aspirations of the people of the later middle ages: and seei
nothing worthy of preservation after the 14th century they did
(and do I am sorry to say) not attempt to preserve later work,
but on the contrary destroyed it, supplanting it by such feeble
copies of the purer work as they could compass in the present
day: with the result that we have been deprived of a great bulk
of art which no age of the world could have afforded to lose, and
which to this age ridden by the nightmare of commercial ugline
has been a grievous loss indeed. ‘
With the third act of the revival came greater and more in

mate knowledge of the art of the Gothic period; and withal a
spread of the knowledge of the conditions of life at that time
without which knowledge indeed mere archeology, though use=
ful, is only useful as building up storage for reference. And now it
did seem to many people that architecture and the arts which

i

in this act some of us thought that the revival might be extended ’

to the accessory arts, and made I assure you desperate efforts to
revive them: in which process we have at least amused and
instructed ourselves a good deal, and even done what is called
“lived on” our efforts; in other words have extracted a good deal
of money out of the public by them: allow me to excuse ourselves
for that brigandage by saying that the public will have these
accessory arts, or some pretence of them, and that if I am not
quite blinded by vanity ours are at any rate prettier [than] those
which went before them.

Before I go further I ought to note one part of the Gothic
revival which most of you will I doubt not think of more impor-
tance than these spasmodic attempts to build a new style of
architecture and decoration on the remains of the older styles:
that part of it I mean which has to do with the art of picture-
painting: in which I must be understood not to be speaking of
landscape art which has I suppose only been affected by the
revival so far as it has tended to make it more realistic and
hon'est: as to imaginative painting it has been affected by it much
as literature has been that is in point of fact it has been reborn
from its influence as could hardly fail to be the case; since on the
one side the revival found it the reality of passion and sentiment
;nsteac! of the obvious imitation of them, and on the other hand it
ound it ornamental scope, or in other words the aim at beauty of

11'::.11;10?1(1 colour which the old pedantry despised and was igno-

And now out of this third act of the Revival we may be said to

 
 

80 The Unpublished Lectures of William Morris

have passed into the fourth which has strengthened the hope of -

many people that a new style of art is forming which will be at ]

once beautiful and at the same time fitting to the life of our own
times: strange to say, though, amidst all this, there has been a sort
of reaction against that very Gothic art which began the architec-

tural revival and at one time seemed to be the end all and be all
of it: this reaction seems to be the legitimate issue of that new- -

s

found knowledge that there is something admirable in mediaeval -

architecture after its highest point of purity had been attained

perhaps also some of the worthy people who started with regen-
erating the arts by imitating the 13th century have grown older
and have more or less sunk their ideals and are prepared to put

up with the quaint bourgeois trimness of a Queen Anne house as.

good enough to make us in this age of ugliness forget the poetry

and beauty of a 14th century grange. In truth there is something

to be said for the exchange of an almost as good as real Queen
Anne house, instead of a very far from as good as real 14th.
century one. To step from a very well done outside of Chaucer’s:

time into an interior of afternoon tea and the music of the futur
is certainly a very prodigious shock; more of a shock, it must be

admitted than finding a Queen Anne house inhabited by school-:

board ladies or gentlemen enthusiastic on sanitary reform: th
days of Prestonpans® are easier for us to understand than those of
Crecy: and yet not easy, for after all Queen Anne is dead: and
moreover imitating the whimsical ghost of a style of the 18
century has the special disadvantage of forcing us to spend ti
and sometimes talent in imitating whims which were absurd eve
in those days, imitating things which were not founded on an
principle: it forces us in fact to affect an affectation. And to fi
with this last freak of the Gothic revival, I must remind you aga )
that whatever was admirable about the quaint old houses of the
middle of the 18th century was simply a survival of the Gothi¢

times; the rest was mere insanity, a mere token of a narrow,
pinched bourgeoisdom.

So much on what may be called the external history of the
architectural Gothic revival: which arising as a necessary conse-
quence of the historical revival and allying itself to an ecclesiasti-
cal-historical movement has in its limited way attained such a
success as to be now undergoing a reaction: you may think
perhaps I have treated this stir in art somewhat lightly; and to
say the truth if I did not feel it to be the sign of something deeper
than itself, I should scarcely think it worth much attention; for it
is confined within very narrow limits, and cannot even be said to
have altered perceptibly the external appearance of our towns,
where in spite of all the talk among Artistic people, the real style
of the day, Victorian Architecture, is in full swing; or in other
words miserable squalor and purse-proud, rampant vulgarity
divide our Architecture between them. But if it is not of much
importance in itself it is of some importance as a token of men’s
minds being turned toward the historic method of looking at life
and the hopes for the future of mankind: for us as I have before
hinted there is no longer a brief period of perfection dropped
down into a world no one knows how or why, an island in a dark
sea of before and after, in which alone a rational man can find
anything worthy of his attention; all reason and order [inside of it]
unreason and anarchy outside of it; one thing to be imitated al-
ways, nothing else to be even looked at. In spite of the trumpery
little reaction I have been speaking of just now, we have done
with all that for ever, and have grasped the idea of the unity and
continuous life of man, in which change and growth are always

- Present, so that although we dare pick out one period and say it is

bad, or another and say it is good, we cannot say this is great and
that is little, for it is all growth together—that is to say life. As

Soon as this is felt by men it must at once influence their aims and

hopes in an art like architecture, and it has been this feeling I am
Sure and not a mere arbitrary liking for some special forms as the
Pointed-arch or what not which has produced the Gothic Revival:

1t was .felt that the mere imitation of classical models itself once
@ genuine historical development, had gone as far as it could go

 

 
 

 

82 The Unpublished Lectures of William Morris

and that we were face to face with a dead wall of pedantry: this
imitation then had to be abandoned, and we were compelled to
seek for a style which had in itself the elements of further growth,
that could only be found in Gothic art which after the fall of the =
old classicism had become the universal style: at first we imitated
the outward aspects of it without understanding its spirit much as
the Renaissance artists had done with the old classical art, but
without infusing any of the spirit of our own times into it as they
had done so as to make a living style: even this however is now to
a certain extent being attempted owing to the knowledge of
history having spread among us till we are beginning to be
conscious of that growth and unity of mankind of which I have
just spoken. 1

This to my mind is the meaning of the Gothic revival; and so
looked upon it becomes I think a movement of great importance
and not a mere excrescence of dilettantism: so that we may well =
ask what practical use can be made of it in civilizing the sur- -
roundings of life, which I fancy we most of us here present are in -
grievous need of being civilized. 3

The question is then what hopes for the future of art lie in the |
present condition of the Gothic revival? It is a difficult question -
and to answer it fully I should have to deal with the most serious i
questions of the day, nor indeed will it be possible for me to i
avoid touching on them before I have done. As far as I can
however I will keep that for the end of my discourse and will now -
try to point out to you certain shortcomings in our neo-Gothic
buildings: only you will understand I shall be thinking of the best
of them, not of the worst; of those where the architect to some
extent understands his style, and would build Gothic if he could,%’
and not of those which are a mere collocation of certain well-
known forms put together in a thoroughly modern way; that is to
say the Carpenters’ Gothic of our day. 8

Well in considering these good specimens of the Gothic revival
one thing is bound to strike us from the first—they are very florid.
There is a determination in them to have a great deal of ornament.
—of some sort. Now you will hardly suspect me, an ornamentalist
of underrating the pleasure which ornament can give us, but inj
this case I will go so far as to plagiarize on my friend W[illiam]

B[lake] R[ichmond]’ and say that as things are at present ’tis
better to be chary of ornament: don’t have any cheap ornament
at all: for real ornament cannot be cheap: at present I say build
big and solid and with an eye to strict utility: you will find that
will be expressive work enough, and will by no means be utilitar-
ian. But let us look into this matter of modern ornament, and see
why you are to be chary of it, and why it is cheap—and nasty.”
Allow me to illustrate my views on the subject by means of an
actual building which I have seen: some four years ago I went
into a church (in the country) built by a friend of mine, an
architect who knows Gothic architecture thoroughly, and I ad-
mired it very much: I think if I had gone into it in the dusk I
should really have taken it for a genuine building of the 15th
century. Well it was a costly building and there was lots of
ornament in it especially in the chancel: the great ornament of
which was a big reredos of carved stone all over the east wall, a
mass of niches and imagery, and at first sight it looked very
beautiful; but as I looked at it I began to get tired of it although I
could find no fault with its design at all; and why was that? Well
there were dozens of figures in the niches, which indeed filled
their places: but when you looked at them you knew very well
what they were; they were carving not sculpture. That is we have
today to use two words which mean the same thing to indicate
two different things: so I say they were carving, that is they were
done by men who really had nothing to do with the design of
them who cut them unfeelingly and mechanically without trou-
bling their heads as to whom they represented, with no trace in

  
 

 

*W. B. Richmond, R.A., was the successor to John Ruskin in the Slade
Professorship of Fine Art at Oxford. He was closely associated with Morris in
many artistic and social endeavors, including the SPAB and the arts and crafts
exhibitions of the eighties and nineties. On his friendship with Morris, which dates
from the days immediately following Morris’s Oxford career, see A. M. W. Stirling,
3""18 Richmond Papers (London, 1926), pp. 157, 164-65, 271, 314.

Cheap and Nasty,” a phrase very popular among the pre-Raphaelites and other
81't.reformers, was first popularized by Charles Kingsley in 1850 in a pamphlet
entitled Cheap Clothes and Nasty. “Its title was the tailor's own slang for
garments made under sweatshop conditions.” Moreover, “much of Alton Locke is a

amatization of Cheap Clothes and Nasty. . . .” See Margaret Farrand Thorp,

them of my friend the architect’s enthusiasm for the Middle Ages,

by men who would just as soon have cut 18th century grave-stone
cherubs, or apples and amoretti® in a new club house; in short -
they were just mechanical dolls nothing more. |
Now just consider what they were taking the place of: as it is
they were I must say positively worthless; but if that reredos had
been filled with genuine imagery of the 15th century it would
have been full of entrancing interest: it is likely that the figures
would have been rudely cut, that they would have shown no 1
great knowledge of anatomy, that the extremities would have °
been clumsy and ugly, the heads disproportionately big, the faces ' ,
not of a high type, the pose of the figure not very graceful and so
forth: in short doubtless they would have plenty of obvious
faults, but that very fact to start with is comparatively in the
favour, for it shows that you would have been compelled to
notice them, to look at them: you couldn’t look at the other stone
dolls at all: with the genuine imagery there would have gone re
thought and invention although the quality of it might have been
rude and not to our taste: every figure would have had something
characteristic about it, something which would have shown you
at a glance that the carver had enjoyed his work and would not
under any compulsion, nay could not, work out of his style: and I
say that the difference between such work and that of the me-
chanical dolls above-mentioned is infinite: one is something and
the other nothing. 4
Now though this may be an extreme case yet the illustration i§
applicable to every bit of ornament about a building: concerning
which you must ask the question is it done by an artist or a
machine—whether of flesh and blood or brass and steel matters
nothing to our present purposes—if it is the latter have nothing te
do with it: it will be worth [a] great [deal] less than nothing: i
the former, well and good, only you must be very particular t¢
see that it is done by an artist’s hand, executed that is to sa}
thoughtfully and with pleasure: in that case it will, I am sorry to
say, be rare, and I imagine expensive, as things go now; only i
will at all events be worth something. Such a principle wi

somewhat restrict the exuberance of ornament, and as I said you
will have to put up with solid plain buildings that will by reason
of their obvious utility have a certain amount of dignity about
them; which will have a double advantage to us: first they will be
good in themselves, that at no time to come will they bring shame
upon us at least; and next that our very restraint and carefulness
in the matter will set us longing for real ornament since the desire
for it is natural to the properly developed human being; whereas
at present being surfeited with the sham stuff which is so com-
mon, we begin to loathe the whole thing, and scarcely look on
what is really good either of our time or past times.

This remark leads me to speaking of the other shortcoming of
the careful architectural works of today, it is soon said: there are
too few of them: there are as I said not enough to make any
impression on the general mass of our modern towns, where the
most of the houses rich as well as poor make no pretence to being
anything more than utilitarian hutches within the case of the rich
ones a certain amount of quite sham ornament laid on simply at
the commands of Mrs. Grundy® without anybody but that imper-
sonal Goddess even professing to be pleased by the transaction;
so it comes to this as the shortcomings of the present learned and

~really architectural buildings, that as on the one hand their orna-

ment when they have any is not genuine or spontaneous, so on
the other they are not numerous enough to form a real style:
which two objections to them taken together seem to me to point
to the simple fact [that] though they are built in this century they

are not of it: they are but exotics in fact: on which fact follows

the question, are they likely to gain so much on the public as to
be the prevailing style, in which case they might, I suppose
compel the development of a due style of ornament exterior and
Interior? For my part I am compelled to answer that question in
ﬂlé negative: under the present conditions of life I cannot see the

day when every little house, every small tradesman’s shop, every ,:

farm building even shall be without effort duly built, architec-

tural, in a word beautiful; and I assert very strongly that until ‘,

such a change comes about there will be no real modern architec-
tural style; so that we may see what further lies in the assertion, -
let us return to the matter of the ornament again, and try to find 5
out why we cannot get it genuine except under very rare condi- |
tions, unless in fact it is done by a man having the name and
position as an artist: why cannot we get it from workmen? 1

The starting point of the answer is obvious: it is because there
is such a division of labour in our occupations nowadays that
there is a trenchant line of demarcation between artists and
workmen, even when the latter are engaged on what are consid-
ered in some sense works of art: the artist is at least independent.
[and] can take a job or leave it according as he thinks it will do
him credit or not: the workman lives from hand to mouth and is
not at all independent: it would be dangerous work for him to’
play with his jobs, to take this and refuse that; or if he has s.
much genius and spirit as to do this, he presently finds himself in
such a position that he can lift himself out of his class and become
a gentleman artist; nor can anyone expect him to abstain from
using his advantage; but take notice how this one thing makes it
impossible for workmen as a body to become artistic, for I repeat
that the possession of genius joined to ordinary thrift and indus
try will deprive the class of workmen of a good craftsman, ang
add to the class of gentlemen probably a poorish artist: therefort
this elimination of talent from the workmen always going on the
cultured architect of today has to depend for the execution of hi
work not on the intelligent cooperation of brother artists, but of
the grudging obedience of trained drudges, from whom it it
absurd to expect any approach to that excellence, thoughtfuln -«
and delicacy which Mr. Richmond has told some of you in thi
city is necessary to any ornament which is worth having,. g

You see we do not expect a mere workman to have any sense “
beauty; that is a luxury which is now confined to the well-to-d
to the classes of leisure: but even if the workman by some e
traordinary accident has that sense of beauty, it is certain that h
will have no opportunity of expressing it in his work: if there is ¢

i

be any pretence of beauty in the work which is to pass through
his hands it will have been arranged for him by some one else’s
mind, and all his mind will have to do with the execution of it
will be to keep before him the fact that he has got to carry out his
pattern neatly perhaps, but speedily certainly under the penalty
of his livelihood being injured: any thought he gives us as he
carries out his task will be so much dead loss to him. Under such
conditions how can you expect architecture to flourish; architec-
ture which is emphatically the harmonious expression of the
sense of beauty inherent in the whole people? Under such condi-
tions nothing is possible in architecture but jerry-built hovels for
the masses and vulgar Victorian architecture for the well-to-do
and rich.

Now since we are thinking of the changes in the future of the
Gothic revival I must ask you to allow me to contrast this condi-
tion of things [to] the condition of the workmen of that Gothic

- period whose art we have been trying to revive.

In their time however labour was divided in[to] the occupa-

tions of men in general, and it was of course much less completely

so than with us: in the crafts there was very little division of

9 labour: every apprentice became a master as a matter of course
and when in the later Middle Ages the guilds had become less
de.mocratic, and contained a class of journeymen alongside of the
privileged craftsmen, the journeyman was only below his master
as to his privileges, not his skill; so that from beginning to end he
had to know his craft and be master of it: furthermore at least

_ before the end of the 14th century the workman was not working
. for a master but for himself and was therefore master of his time:
" and also his work being done there was little of the middleman’s

‘t)iﬂice to take away a share of his earnings from him: the transac-
- tion between him and the public was simple: a piece of work was

them he could afford to show his pleasure in the work of orna-
menting it: which ornament springing from deliberate work and

ample leisure showed manlike invention and imagination in it,
controlled indeed by intercourse with his fellow men then alive, -
and by tradition, that is by the thoughts of those who had gone I
before him but not controlled by the sordid necessity of working -
to a pattern prescribed by an irresponsible master.

Now if you have followed me you will take note that these are .
the conditions under which artists work; and in fact the crafts-
men® of the middle ages were all artists, and art or the creation of
beauty was a habit to them which they could not forego if they
would; and hence happened then which I have said was neces-
sary to a real style of beautiful architecture that all building was
beautiful; which beauty if we now want we have at least to pay
extra for, if indeed we get it by paying extra which is doubtful: it
was once a free gift like the air of heaven; it is now a marketabl
article, and like all other marketable articles is much
adulterated.

Here then I want you to understand once for all that the
Gothic art which we have tried to revive was the work of free
craftsmen working for no master or profit-grinder, and capable
expressing their own thoughts by means of their work, which was
no mere burden to them but was blended with pleasure; that ar
or beauty was a necessary incident to all handicraft and was no
paid for as a distinct article but was given in over and above j ;_
as the colour in an apple or the lovely drawing in a wheat ear is
On the contrary in reviving Gothic art the cultivated men whi
are striving to bring in a rational and popular style of architectur
and decoration are condemned to see their work carried out b

workmen who are working for a master who has to grind a n'l
out of them and so can afford them neither leisure nor thought i
their work, and who are in consequence incapable of expressin
their thoughts through their work; which is accordingly a m'
burden to them unmingled with pleasure: from which it come
that so far from beauty being a necessary incident to all hand

work, it is always absent from it unless it is bargained for as a
special separate article having its own market value.

This then is the real bar to the success of the Gothic revival
which aimed at bringing back reasonable, logical beauty to the
life of man in civilized countries: it is not as some have supposed
the difference in life otherwise, except so far as the stupid luxury
of the rich and idle is founded on the oppression of the workers:
it is the subjection of all labour to the necessities of the competi-
tive market which stands in the way of the Gothic revival, as it
was the beginnings of that subjection which brought about the
degradation of art in the 16th century, and the development of
?;eh same tyranny which completed that degradation in the

And lest you should think as some men now seem to do that
this Gothic revival or the revolt against tyranny in the arts is a
light matter, and that it will henceforth be a sufficient compro-
mise for our architects and us to make with the natural love of
beauty, if from henceforward we agree to copy with as much
delicacy of detail as we can the work of a period which does not
profess to appeal to our feelings in any way, to copy some skill-
fully-designed but dull building—lest you should think that this
will make a school of architecture or be an expression of our sense
of beauty worthy of civilized times, lest you should think in a
word that such a proceeding was worth doing at all, let me put
before you the ideal of a school of architecture a school of popular
art,” an ideal which once approached fulfilment amid all the tur-
moil and superstition of the middle ages, and which should surely
be* easier of fulfilment now unless our boasts of civilization

* should turn out to be as I fear they may merely futile and empty

words meaning nothing.

the hope to begin and the courage and patience to carry out to an 1
end from father to son such works as these. Was it fear of the -
jealous Gods and the hope of appeasing their wrath? Was it pride
in the glory and mastery of a great nation? Do not think it: such
motives might perhaps urge on a Pharaoh to build himself a
Pyramid-tomb by means of slave-labour, but the teeming event-
fulness and solemn mass of a Gothic Cathedral sprang from -
worthier thought than this: there have been nay are other means
of satisfying such futile and disastrous passions as superstition
and false patriotism which have used up men’s lives in crueler
ways than the production of works of art. Surely the root cause -
for making whatever is noble and beautiful must always be the
strong desire for the production of beauty; and these glorious :
works which were of necessity the creation of the whole people
were created by the people’s aspirations towards nobility and
beauty. i
They are the outcome of corporate and social feeling, the wo: '3
not of individual but collective genius; the expression of a grea
body of men conscious of their union: if their builders had striven
for beauty mechanically, artifically, if they had been coaxed out
of the people by the bribes of the rich or the tyranny of
powerful they would on the face of them have borne tokens
that corruption and oppression: they would have lacked the life
which we all consciously or unconsciously feel which they possess
and the love with which we have surrounded that life: they
would by this time have become to us dead toys of time past,
living memorials of it: it was the art of the people which create
them to live. e
Now aspiration towards beauty, the hope of giving a las Hing
gift to the world, this of itself might you would think, be motive
sufficient for the fashioning of a great work of collective art: but
there was more motive power behind the workers than that anc
more direct power also: for it is of the essence of such works, 0

slaves: for if they sacrificed their lives and their ease to their
work they would be doing so of their own free will: but, and this
is most important to remember, even this free-will sacrifice is not
asked for by art: for art cannot endure waste, and all sacrifice
means waste, or the loss of some joy which we have a right to
claim: free men don’t ask for martyrs: every martyr implies some
thousands of sneaks.

In collective art therefore is no martyrdom: the men who build
it up not only give their gift of free will, but give it joyfully day
by day, and take as they give, to the extinction of moody pride, to
the fostering of hearty goodwill: not martyrs—but friends and
good fellows.

Take now some one great work of collective or popular art, and
in some such way as follows I think it will have been done: the
hope and desire for it moving in people’s minds stir up some
master mind to plan it; but he is not puffed up with individual
pride by finding himself ready for this creation; for he knows well
that he could not even have thought of it without the help of
those who have gone before him, and that it must remain a mere
unsubstantial dream without the help of his fellows alive now
and to live hereafter: it is the thoughts and hopes of men passed

- away from the world which, alive within his brain, make his plan

take form; and all the details of that plan are guided, will he or
will he not, by what we call tradition, which is the hoarded skill
of man handed down from generation to generation. But, as he
belongs to the past and is a part of it, so also he belongs to the

~ present and the future: his plan must be carried out by other men

living and to live, who share his thoughts, his memories of bygone

- times, and the guidance of tradition: through these men he must

help it forward one whit unless it is shared by all men. And if
they think that that will be an easy thing to bring about they aré
wrong. For the division into the cultivated and the uncultivated
classes, or to put the matter plainer into the civilized and uncivil
