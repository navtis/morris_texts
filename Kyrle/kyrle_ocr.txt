THE KYRLE
‘TRY HALL,

      

cating before you the claims of the Kyrle Society to pub-
lic support; its case is almost too good to bear much
king about it; it seems to me a question with only one
side to it, and that it cannot be debated. The Society isin the
position of having no enemies; it neither has them, nor, I
should say, can have them, therefore it must dispense alto-
gether with the most effective means of attracting public
attention; which I suppose to be a good hearty quarrel with
192

    
‘one’s fellow human beings, one’s fellow-countrymen. And
really if it be hard for anyone to make many words on this
peaceful subject it must be specially hard for me, since I be-
long to other societies that it seems are particularly offen
sive; societies that count their foes by the thousand and
their friends by the unit: so that now when I have to say
something about this most inoffensive, but most useful So-
ciety, I feel like a fish out of water, and don’t know what to
say except that it is useful. Yet you must understand that I
use the word enemies in a narrow sense, meaning by the
word irritated human beings: but in another sense it has
‘enemies, who are indeed enemies to the whole human race,
but in their present form are peculiar to our own time and
perhaps to our own nation; their names are Carelessness,
‘Ugliness, and Squalor. The Kyrle Society has been founded
to fight against these, and has fought against them in a
humble and unobtrusive manner, which was at the same
time the manner readies to hand; and it now seeks to rally
you against them, and to ask you to help it somewhat in its
‘own special warfare against these oppressive evils—evils
which modern civilization has changed in form, but kept
in substance, evils which are specially bred by our system
of huge towns and above ll by thi great city, or rather by
thisland of bricksand mortarcalled London. What dread-
ful place I used to think it when I sometimes came into it as
a boy! We have got used to it now, and cannot see it a
really is; but if we could do so fora few hours, whata night-
mare we should think it! I cannot help fancying that we
should give up many things that now seem important to us,
and turn to and try to amend it to the utmost of our power.

‘Meanwhile there areamongstus various ways of treating
these evils, the squalor and ugliness that come of careless-
ness and despair: the first is the simplest, it is to shut one’s
esto them, and sty, and pechap to think that they don't
‘exist: those who can take this way I must really call fortu-
nate, too fortunate tobe numerous, [should think: myself
Idon’t know any of these happy people.

Well then next, there are those who admit the existence
ofthe evils aforesaid, and say ‘twere well if they could be got
rid of, but since they are a necessary part of the life of the
nineteenth century, and of all other centuries to come; since
wwe can't get rid of them, let us bear them as well as we can,
and forget them: indeed a good many of this easy-going
folk do manage to bear their neighbours’ troubles pretty
well. Fortunate, theyalso, I suppose we must say;and yet—
isitnot somewhat strange that they have never thought that
since these evils live, they muét follow the laws of life, and
grow also; that they have never thought what they may
grow into, what terrible monsters, born of them, society
shaken out ofits sloth may have one day to face?

Again there is another way of dealing with these evils,
about which I know more than I do of the others: there are
soine of us who know how real, how heavy, how pressin
these evils are, and who are grieved by them even amid:
their own well-to-do and happy lives: nor can we for one
‘moment suppose that they are a part of the eternal order of
things, that they are inseparable from the progress of the
race from savagery to civilization: they seem to us rather to
be the outcome of the blindness and hurry of short-lived
men, who as it seems when they set themselves ardently to
seek one good must needs forget another. All this we know
and feel, and long fora change for the better, and even hope
for it, remembering the course of history.

Yet the very keenness with which these of us feel the
crimes of civilization, the squalor with which it has sur-
rounded the lives of most men, is aptto betray us into doing.
nothing. So huge the contrast is between what waits to be
done, and what is possible to be done at once, that we are
couraged, Hy

For think of the lofty ideal that lies before us, of Society

bby all; when the man of the most refined occupation, étu-

dent, artist, physician, what not, shall be able to speak to
him who does the roughest labour in a tongue that they both
know, and to find no intricacy of his mind misunderstood
and when asa sign and symbol ofall this, and the necessary
outcome oft, this very London, which even many years ago
Cobbettin his disgust would call the wen, shall have become
a delightful abode of men, full of beauty and guiltless ofany
spot of squalor.

All this we can see as something that might be if people
in general would but once for all settheir hearts on it, nay,
as something that one day will be, whatever gulf may lie
between it and us: but we do not know how to set to work
to bridge that gulf full of possible violences and revolutions,
and of certain disappointments. Nay, that is a great word;
wwe do not even know what it may be of some little use to
throw into the gulf'as a beginning of the foundation for the
bridge that after ages shall build. We who long, it may be
no less than any, for the coming day of our ideal, do not
know, outside the ordinary daily duties of our lives, whither-
‘ward to turn our hands that we may help that coming day
one step forward.

So however happy those may be who cannot see, and will
dot ctte, we cannot be happy. L wil say for us that we have
at least the grace to be discontented. And unless we are to
live and die in our discontent there is nothing for it, but to
do something, the first thing that comes to hand, 10 rhe 1
moit of our poreer, not fearing that meantime our ideal will
‘escape our vision, nor overweighted by the sense of the i
significance of what each of us personally can do against the

ourselves in the faith, that when our share of the work is.
over, others will take it up: the cause needs us and will use
us, but it will not stand still for our departure, but will carry
‘our workalong with us for ever.

‘Now it seems to me that this is the way along which the
Kyrle Society desires to go: this is the spirit in which it sets
about its work: of the details ofthat work others can tell you.

both encouraging those who are condemned life-long to the
prison of a squalid London Street to try to make the best
even of that, and also as trying to stir in their minds that
longing for beauty which even yet lies dormant in most
men's hearts. That the Society has been able in some degree
todo this, is clear from the constant applications for its ser-
vices, and from the very fact that it has to-day definitely put
itself before the public.

And I must take leave to say that those who may think
this a contribution of small moment towards the perfection
of our civilization, do not know whence art springs or
whitherward it aims, Its aim is the making life happy and
dignified for ai/ people. To succeed in such an aim, is it not
necessary that it should both spring from and be cherished
by the peopl at large? Believe meyif today it seems other-
wise, if art has taken refuge altogether among the highest
intelligences and the greatest cultivation, itis because it has
for the moment ceased to be progressive, and rests upon the
memory of the popular energy of past times, and if this be
not changed, if the people do not insist on having their
share of it, I know most surely that art will die out of civili-
zation. | am wondering if civilization will live when art is
dead.

Now for myself I believe that what the Society has aétual-
ly carried out in various ways is far from unimportant: but
if by chance any over sanguine or impatient person should
think the achievements small, I would bid him consider
how important a work the Society does by calling public
attention to these matters: itis no malice or ill-will that has
brought about the evils I have been speaking of, only
thoughtlessness. Remember what wonderful things men
have done when they wanted to do them: what energy and
ingenuity past belief almost, people in this country have
spent in carrying out things they have set their hearts on,
sometimes, I must say, little to their own benefit or that of
theworld at large: think of allthis, I say, and then tell me if
Tam wrong in saying, that if it be impossible to turn this
London of ours fom being the disgrace to civilization
which it nowis, into being a beautiful abode of man, ifit be
impossible to make London what the old ballad calls it—

Wall, I know it will be a difficult thing to do: a long
piece of work to abolish our enemies, Carelessness, Squalor,
and Ugliness: butit is because I do not think itimpossible,
because I will never accept the counsels of despair, but will
believe that the good time is on the road, that I stand before
