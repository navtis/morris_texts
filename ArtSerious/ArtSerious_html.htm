 
<h1>ART: A SERIOUS THING<a href="#section1">[1]</a></h1>

<h2>By William Morris</h2>

<p>Some six weeks ago I had occasion to go from London to a
place not far from here (called Manchester if you must
know)<a href="#section2">[2]</a>, we left London about 9 in the morning I think on
rather a cold morning, with a white frost on the grass and a
thickish mist piled above it some feet into the air, though it was
visibly not a foul-weather day; well we went on so till we got to
the foot of those chalk hills near Tring, the Chilterns I suppose,
there we ran into a tunnel, and coming out on the other side were
off the clay; being off the clay we were also out of the mist, and
into the bright morning sun: it was an almost magical change,
instead of the white thick mist through which one could barely
see the ghost of a tree here and there, the bright hill-sides lay
before us with the pleasant homesteads lying at their feet surrounded 
by the autumn elm-trees, and the sky above was clear
blue though pale, while the only sign of the mist that had hidden
meadows, houses, and all while we were on the clay, was a
wreath or two of white vapour dragging along some of the hollows 
halfway up the hill: indeed it was all very beautiful, and I
settled myself down to enjoy myself, knowing how little there is
amusing to look at on the L.[ondon] and N.[orth] W.[estern]
railway till you have got clear of the pottery towns: but I had
scarcely got my eyes well focussed on it when — crick — my neighbour 
opposite found the sun was in his eyes and pulled down the
blind. I was so vexed that I was really inclined to be uncivil to the
good man, who for the rest didn’t look very ruffianly; like a
business man I should say, his countenance bearing no particular
expression of any sort; just that look of mingled boredom and
anxiety which [is] the usual expression of the modern Anglo-Saxon 
face: I suppose I ought to have suggested a change of seats
to him, but I was too shy, so I just flounced off angrily to the
other side, the unsunny side, of the carriage, and looked out of
the window, which was also the dull and flat side as well as the
unsunny; however there was something to be looked at, and my
anger gradually faded away, while something in the sunny
glimpse I had had reminded me of a window which was opened
to me last year in the midst of Paris, and this is what I saw from
that window:<a href="#section3">[3]</a></p>

<p>In the foreground I saw a sort of corridor or cloister of lovely
and delicate round-arched architecture in which sat a slim serious-visaged 
woman dressed in a gown of deep blue; she was
sitting for her portrait, and the painter who was taking it was
serious of face also with a look of staid but refined enthusiasm,
and was dressed in rich but sober stuffs: the cloister was in
half-tone almost, but the sun shone widely abroad without, serene 
but not glittering: a quaint flowery garden I saw stretching
down from the cloister pillars, 2 peacocks strutting about the
path: the garden ended in a terraced battlemented wall over
which leaned two burgher-like persons dressed in red and blue
cloth of antique cut and looked at the landscape beyond: indeed
they might well look for even what I could see of it was fair
enough: we were in some house, an Abbey I think, but certainly
high up on a hill out into terraces, and below the garden wall I
could see a river running through a rich country of meadow and
hill slopes; an islet split the river some way up and beyond it was
a bridge guarded at both ends and the middle by ashlar-built
towers: past this I could see the river coming down from hills
that grew higher and higher till at last they grew into mountains
and rose higher yet till their snow-capped summits cut the clear
pale sky so far and far away.</p>

<p>That was the window I looked out in the gallery of the Louvre
at Paris, and I thought I had not come all the way from London
for nothing since I had seen all that, which I shall never any more
forget.</p>

<p>Now he who opened that window to me and keeps it open for
whomever will cross the narrow seas, has been dead near 500
years ago;<a href="#section4">[4]</a> when he was alive he was a citizen of a city which he
called in his country tongue the bridges, but which we today call
Bruges, and his name was John Van Eyck, the brother of Hubert
and Margaret; all three of them had wondrous skill of hand, 
which however would have served them but little as window-openers 
but for the eyes they had and the diligent use they made
of them; now that kind of use of the senses which nature has
given us and joined in a strange way to that other part of us
which we call the mind and soul is what I wish to recommend to
all who are here present, not only to those who use their hands in
trying to tell us what they think they see, and who are called
artists, but also to other reasonable people, as a means for curing
that bored and anxious expression of the Anglo-Saxon countenance, 
which, give me leave to say, is a ridiculous mask to put on
our faces in a world which has or ought to have so much to
interest a reasonable man as ours has or ought to have.</p>

<p>In passing I may say that my window-shutting fellow traveller
turned out to be good-natured enough and not unintelligent, but
it was quite clear that he never used his eyes for looking at
anything that his business or his bodily wants didn’t compel him
to look: his landscape was bounded by his ledger and his mutton
chop.</p>

<p>Here is a contrast to that long-dead citizen of Bruges to whom
I owe such gratitude, I and many another; for indeed you need
not cross the narrow seas to look through his eyes, for in no
prettier or cleaner place than Trafalgar Sq.<a href="#section1">[5]</a> in London you can
see a chamber in Bruges city, and a man and his wife standing
hand in hand amidst their household goods just as they stood 500
years ago, and to make it clear to all that he really did see it, the
citizen of Bruges above-named wrote on the wall in gold letters,
‘Ego Johannes de Eyk fuit hic’: ‘I John Van Eyck was here.'</p>

<p>I say that is a great contrast, which however is only worth
noticing because the man who snuffed out the sunlit Chilterns for
me was no monster of stupidity, but the type of a class, and that
class comprises the most of people nowadays; and once more I
say no wonder that such people look bored and anxious.</p>

<p>Further the remedy to this strange perversity which I commend 
to all reasonable people is to use their eyes to wit. I am
bound chief of all to commend to such of you as are definitely
studying art, as we call it, to those of you whose special business
1t is to see yourselves and to make others see what there is in the
world: by which indeed you will gain some insight both into what
has been and what will be in it: with you it lies to get people in
general to use their eyesight, for you can give them examples of
the benefit of doing so: there is, or perhaps I may hopefully say,
there was an idea abroad that the artist was a lazy, loafing sort of
fellow, who if he were born of well-to-do people became an artist
for the same sort of reason that his brother went into the army
or the church, in order namely that he might escape hard work; or
if he were an artisan work pretty hard at high wages 2 days a
week so that he might be lazy and probably drunk the other 4
days: I say that was the idea of [the] result of a man being born
with some artistic gift, if he were so ill-advised as to let the said
gift have any scope and carry him into a fatal course of life.</p>

<p>Well, the amount of truth that may be at the bottom of this
theory, I can dimly discern, but so dimly, that it is not worth while
to try to put it into words for you: because practically and as far
as dealing with the actualities of life, from a business point of
view, let me say there is no truth in the theory.</p>

<p>I have the honour and advantage of knowing several artists of
the higher kind, and nothing about their way of working is more
noteworthy than the pains they take: they will not allow anything 
to come easy to them, for they are forever intent in making
the very best of their talent, and when they have got the mastery
over one point, they don’t rest and be thankful, but go on to
master another: they don’t hug themselves on the work that they
have done; hope which lit their path till that work was turned out
of hand, has died out of it now, and is shining on the work which
they have to do: nothing can be ever done well enough for them.
Pray is this likely to be a lazy, loafing kind of life?</p>

<p>I don’t want to find fault anywhere if I can help it, but you
must pardon me for saying that if our law-makers and law-administrators, 
our practical common sense men of business, who can
be trusted worked half as hard, and single-heartedly as our real
artists do — why England would be quite a decent place to live in.</p>

<p>Mind I say our real artists, and I don’t profess to think there
are many of them: there are plenty of pretenders to the title, as
there are in all occupations, who are criminal nuisances nothing
short of it: so please to remember all you that are studying art
that you have a heavy responsibility on your shoulders: if you are
less than honest in your work, and you may judge by what I have
just been saying what my standard of honesty is, if you are less
than honest I say, every act of your artistic life is a nail in the
coffin of art, or in plain words of civilization, or in plainer words
still, of the hope of mankind to live a decent life fit for men.</p>

<p>Indeed I suppose that the fact of your having made up your
minds to study art shows that you have some gifts in that direction: 
but pray don’t play with the matter, but find out through
any failures if it must be so what your gifts are: then the worst
that can happen will be that you will find out that you have no
gifts for art, in which case, out with the knife — cut it all away,
and betake yourselves to some other occupation, and you will at
any rate have saved yourselves loss of time, and self-respect.</p>

<p>But the worst case will not be common: most men have still
some gifts towards the arts which can be brought to light if they
have opportunities for developing them; that last sentence shows
you the meaning of the schools of art which have been established 
to teach people to use their eyes, and to eschew drawing
down blinds on sunlit landscapes.</p>

<p>These opportunities for developing your talents, will if you use
them properly show you infallibly what you can attempt, and
what you had better leave alone: in the first place I believe that
nearly as many people can be taught to draw anything that will
stand still, as can be taught to write: well, well, I do assure you
that many people are incapable of learning writing, even distinguished ones: 
I think the ghost of Dean Stanley<a href="#section6">[6]</a> for instance will
forgive me for saying that he was one of them.</p>

<p>Now, though a man may draw well in a sense, and still not be
an artist in any sense, still the acquirement of the art will be
useful to him even then, and I think it ought to be taught more
widely and more systematically than it is, even looking at it from
that point of view. But if you can learn to draw not only mechanically, 
but artistically also, that is to say, in such a way that it is
obvious to those who can use their eyes that you have had
pleasure in the drawing, and a hope of carrying on your art
further, if this be the case, then you can lay claim to be an artist
of some sort: in striving to find out of what sort, to what rank of
artist you belong you will doubtless have difficulties and disappointments, 
but it will all come right in the end, so long as you
are honest in your work: nor, as long as there is any real appreciation 
of art, need any man quarrel with himself because his rank as
an artist is humble; everyone comes to the end of his tether step
by step whether he be great or small; and let me tell you, that
though every real artist aspires to do his best, and ever to better
it, yet every real artist has also in him a fund of content, or if you
please so to call it of humility: withal I repeat that whenever art
is at all approximately in the state that it should be there is room
for artists of all capacities from the greatest to the least: to be a
pretender, a bungler, that is to be not a humble artist, but none at
all; and the distance between the humblest man who can do a
thing, and the showiest pretender who can <em>not</em> is not to be
measured at all, it is infinite, the difference between nothing and
something.</p>

<p>I think sometimes that there have been ages in the world’s
history of which ours is one, that have thought over much of the 1
glories of great men, and not enough of the welfare of common
men; such ages have had a tendency to carry due hero-worship,
which is a proper and necessary thing, into superstition; by which
they not only injure their great men, flattering them like flunkies
instead of honouring them like men and their very fellows, but
also are easily led astray into taking pretentious men for great
ones, not remembering that the foundation of all greatness is
humility; you must be a man first before you are a great man.
Now all artists cannot be Michael Angelos, but all can be worthy
fellows and helpmates for him: and he will be the first to acknowledge 
this, the first to feel the want of such helpmates and
fellows, if unhappily the time does not breed them for him: be
sure that every great artist will do full justice to any piece of
artistic work which is good and sound of its kind, and will not
despise it because it does not profess to solve ‘the riddle of the
painful earth’ in a hurry: indeed he need do justice to it, for it
will show him that there is at least someone who can sympathize
with his troubles and triumphs; he can no more do without an
audience than can any other interpreter between nature and
man; and I will go bail for it if he is a man of any note, he has had
enough of the kind of worshipper who will stand before his easel,
and say “charming!” looking out of the window at nothing all the
time.</p>

<p>But remember this great man who will be sympathetic, indulgent even, 
for all genuine work will have nothing but justice for
all empty pretence: the slap-dash and the vague they will send
back to their grammar, and bid them learn before they try to
teach.</p>

<p>I say remember this, and don’t be too mild in judging yourselves, 
however kind you are to others: and as to how you are to
judge yourselves, I must say again use your eyes: your own eyes,
you understand, in one way or other, and not other people’s: for I
have noticed that one is often rather anxious for the favourable
opinion of others on a piece of work which in one’s own heart one
has condemned already.</p>

<p>Now as to the standard of comparison by which you are to
judge your work, apart from the works of the great master,
nature, I would have you take a high standard; nor be discouraged 
at the apparent difference between your attempts and this
exemplary accomplishment: it is part of the great gifts of all
thoroughly good work, and finely illustrates the fellowship of all
genuine workmen little and great which I have been speaking of
that such work does not discourage the learner, but encourage
him: I suppose the reason for this is that the great natural principles 
on which it was done shine through the workmanship, and
are, tacitly or not, understood by those who are honestly aspiring
to do good work: while on the contrary coming across a bad and
pretentious piece of work, does not exhilarate a successful artist
with a sense of superiority but depresses him with a feeling of
doubt as to the value of his own work: so immeasurable is the
difference between bad and good in the arts, so unceasing the
evil that falseness gives birth to.</p>

<p>Now again as to your standard of excellence though I do not
wish to be considered a pedant or even a mere antiquarian, I do
think you will judge yourselves better by comparison with work
that has stood the test of ages, and is still accounted excellent,
than if you used contemporary work to test yourselves by: to say,
I can do as well as or better than my fellows, people who are in
the same hobble as ourselves, that is apt to lower our standard, I
think, and reduces what ought to be calm and cool judgment of
our own work by ourselves to a mere piece of competition, and
competition which is apt to be decided by reference to conventional 
standards applied by people who do not thoroughly know
us.</p>

<p>Well, I have caught myself for some little time past advising
you that are art students here; caught myself, I say because I feel
shy of doing this to an audience I am not thoroughly acquainted
with, and who are taught by competent teachers on a definite and
well-considered plan:<a href="#section7">[7]</a> all I can say in excuse is that it rather leads
up to what I am going to say to you, and which I would say to
any audience, whatever their calling might be.</p>

<p>A while ago I was speaking of what I considered the erroneous
estimate that was and perhaps still is made by people of the effect
of the study and practice of art on the lives of the artists: quite
conventionally made, let me add, for the people who hold that
view know nothing whatever of artists’ lives or the difficulties
of their work: In trying to confute this erroneous impression
which people have or had of art, I spoke almost entirely of the
kind of workman whom we today call an <em>artist:</em> that is to say a
man whose work is demanded entirely by the necessities of the 
mind; but there is another kind of workman whose work is demanded 
partly by the necessities of the body: him we call by
various names, which I am ashamed to say do in most people’s
minds imply inferiority: artisan for instance, or operative: as
these names are certainly not English, and to my mind there is a
smack of insult about them, as withal their etymological meaning
is vague, I shall by your leave use an English word in their stead;
a word full of meaning, and to all reasonable people implying
honour and not reproach: I shall use the word handicraftsman.</p>

<p>Please excuse a word or two etymological, which also will have
a serious bearing on our general subject of the arts; and let me
remind you that the word craft and its adjective crafty have been
degraded and misapplied in modern English very unfortunately
as I think: they are used to express trickiness or dishonesty,
where we ought to use the words guile or guileful: oddly enough
by the way our kinsmen on the other side of the herring-pond
have served the word clever in the same way, while they use the
word ‘cunning’ in its true sense, ‘knowing’ viz. Well, the right
meaning of the word craft is simply power: so that a handicraftsman 
signifies a man who exercises a <em>power</em> by means of his hands,
and doubtless when it was first used was intended to signify that
he exercised a certain kind of power; to wit, a readiness of mind
and deftness of hand which had been acquired through many
ages, handed down from father to son and increased generation
by generation: surely a class of men who possess such a power is
a class to be honoured and thanked rather than nicknamed by
foolish outlandish words.</p>

<p>Well anyhow this kind of man is or ought to be the other kind
of artist who is or was conventionally considered to be a ‘loose
fish' by prescriptive right: but I should call that opinion a libel on
him if I had not heard it said that 'twas a maxim of law, the
greater the truth the greater the libel: so the first syllable of the
word <em>libel</em> must answer my purpose: for my own part I know by
experience that ever so little of the artist added to the handicraftsman 
makes him a more profitable man to employ, to say
nothing of the effect of art on himself, as giving some additional
pleasure and interest to his life.</p>

<p>Thus much I have been saying of the artist and the handicraftsman 
as if they were naturally two distinct classes of workers: I
Suppose it is almost the universally received opinion not only that
it is so, which is obvious, but also that it is natural and right that
it should be so.</p>

<p>But if that be so, I will ask in the first place, what is intended to
be done by all the schools of art and the like, which have been
established under the superintendence of the Depart[ment] of
Sci[ence] and Art?<a href="#section8">[8]</a> Are they intended to turn out any number of
artists? and if so what kind of artists, and how are they going to
live: my impression is that there is a pretty sharp struggle for
subsistence in what may be called the lower ranks of those we
call artists.</p>

<p>The fact is these schools were not intended to turn out what
are conventionally termed artists, they were intended first for
general artistic education, and second for the special education of
those who design for industrial arts. As for the result of the
second of these purposes, I have some doubts if it has quite
answered the expectations formed, as for that of the first I suppose 
it has not been disappointing on the whole; at all events
from whencesoever it comes there is more interest felt in art than
there used to be; and moreover there was assuredly an idea in
those who founded these places of education that some tincture
would not spoil the handicraftsman but would improve him; in
short that it is not natural and right that the artist should be
wholly dissociated from the handicraftsman.</p>

<p>Meantime however, the wide distinction remains as wide as
ever; the only difference made by the spread of artistic education
is that there are more, and I hope better artists than there were; if
a handicraftsman shows any decidedly artistic talents, instead of
remaining in his craft, and illuminating it, so to say by his talents,
he climbs up out of it into the class of artists, the craft that really
needed his talent has lost it; the profession that did not specially
want it has gained it, and probably smothered it into invisibility:
surely there is waste of power here, waste of craftsmanship.</p>

<p>Well now I can understand some of you saying; but are you a
crusted old Tory? would you prevent a clever man from rising in
the world? because whereas when he was a handicraftsman he
was not a <em>gentleman,</em> now he is one, since he is an artist, and so
he has risen a step even if he hasn’t bettered his income; would
you we say prevent the man from rising?</p>

<p>Indeed I mustn’t say what I am, but I suppose I may go as far
as to say what I am not, and that is a crusted old Tory: so in any
case I am glad if a clever man rises, and know well that in order
to rise he must do as I have been saying as things are — more’s the
pity! more’s the waste! and to be plain with you, you won’t better
the matter on this side till you have got rid of all that folly of
calling a man a gentleman or denying him the title according as
he works in this or that way; all that quaint heraldic jargon with
the mismanagement of forces and unfairness that goes with it.</p>

<p>Now don’t misunderstand me, I don’t want a mere confusion of
the different grades of artists for I have said before that such
grades must exist; but there must be no sharp distinction if we
are to have art worth the trouble, widespread and ‘understanded
of the people’: if we are to have popular art.</p>

<p>If things are to go on as they are now what will art amount to
when we clear our eyes and look into the matter without fear of
making ourselves disagreeable: in fact without hypocrisy? To my
mind it will amount to this:</p>

<p>There will be on the one hand a great body of artists so-called
turning out most of them unsatisfactory work not for lack of
talent, but because their talent will be misapplied; they will be
compelled to be gentlemen and more or less useless because they
are more talented than their fellows, and so are to be set to
supply the demand for <em>fine art</em> as 'tis called, and not really being
artists <em>enough</em> for that demand will have to supply a substitute
for it, which will receive very languid attention from the public in
general, yet more attention than it will deserve: above the heads
of these will be a very few men of genius, who at the expense of
great toil and suffering will have acquired real mastery over their
art, and will produce works of art of a high quality, but which
will not in the least be ‘understanded of the people’ partly from
their fault or rather misfortune, partly from the fault or misfortune 
of the people.</p>

<p>All this will supply the languid demand for the more intellectual 
side of art: the fine arts: but there is still a demand for the
less intellectual side of the arts to wit the ornament of the industrial 
arts, that side of it which should be done by handicraftsmen.
How is that to be supplied if things are to go on as they are? Well,
the handicraftsmen can’t supply it, if the article is to be genuine,
for they are not taught to be artists, nay are not allowed to be,
are in fact turned into ‘operatives’ which I take it is another name
for machines.</p>

<p>Now the machines some of which will be of steel and brass and
some of flesh and bone will not turn out art, for a machine cannot
do it, but they will turn out a substitute for it, which will be sold
very cheap, but will not be worth the money it costs, for it will be
worth nothing.</p>

<p>So that will be the art produced by the wasteful system of
forcing men to do what they are unfit to do simply because we
have fallen into a groove and will not get out of it: let us look at it
clearly and see what it means.</p>

<p>First at the top of the tree will come very scanty however
precious fruit, the art done by great men struggling under great
disadvantages, the worst of which will be that the public in
general will have little sympathy for them.</p>

<p>Then lower down the fruit will be tolerably plenteous, but
unripe of little use as it is: the art of a good number of men of fair
talents, but undisciplined, and striving to do what they have no
chance to do really well: such art will be plausible pretension,
but unsatisfying: nobody will care much about it because it will
not have the root of the matter in it.</p>

<p>Last and lowest will come a very strange fruit indeed, which
nobody will want, and nobody will be willing to pay for, but
which will go on being produced from a sort of habit: that will be
the position of ornamental art so-called; to be allowed to exist
when it does not get in the way of the machine which is to be
used for producing riches that nobody will be able to use.</p>

<p>Well, there is one comfort about it, that such a state of things 
cannot last very long: civilized man will either say, ‘let us have an
end of this folly called art and live like decent beasts—' or what
else will happen?</p>

<p>Indeed I should hope that man, even when he is so civilized as
to be forced to live in Burslem or Widnes or Manchester<a href="#section9">[9]</a> will still
have some longing for beauty left him, enough at all events to
feel discontented with the sweet spots I have just named, and
that he will cast about to see if something cannot be done to get
him as large a share of it as a red-skin or a Zulu gets for himself,
and if by some means art cannot be begun again; in which case
what ideal will he look up to beyond the humble present endeavours 
to bring art to a healthy new birth again? What ideas will he
have as to what art has to do for him, and what kind of sacrifices
will he be bound to make for it?</p>

<p>Surely, first of all he will remember that no pyramid can stand
on its apex, but must stand on its base: he will know that before
anything worthy to be called art can exist, it must be longed for
by the whole people, and he will look forward to the day when no
one save a few curious exceptions, men of more or less diseased
minds, will fail to understand art and to demand his due share of
it: in that day though there will be gradations of art from the
humblest to the most exalted, there will [be] no sham art, nor
even any bungling, because everyone who works with his hands
will find out his real and proper place, and will do his best in it:
and between all handicraftsmen will be mutual help and sympathy; 
they will all keep touch, as the drill sergeants call it: the
great artist will think it a matter of course that his house and the
goods in it should be made beautiful and interesting by the
hearty thought and happy deftness of his humbler guild-brother,
who in his turn will not find that the great master speaks to him
in an unknown tongue: moreover it will be a consequence of this
that civilized man will no longer seem (as he does now) to be the
enemy of nature, to shame her and befoul her, and turn her rest
and order and beauty into feverish ragged squalor: the house
shall be like a natural growth of the meadow, and the city a
necessary fulfillment of the valley. Nor is that all, nor the most of
it: for this outward order and beauty will be but a token of fair
and orderly life, of days made up of unwearisome work, and of
leisure restful but not vacant: of a life in which year by year the
land of his fathers shall grow dearer and fairer to a man as he gets
to know it better and better, although his times be cast in a place
where nature wears her everyday clothes, no queen but a thrifty
housewife: so that when he goes into other lands richer of startling 
beauty and wild romance, he will fare not as a man driven
by dullness that nothing can brighten, by weariness that no
idleness can soothe, but as a pilgrim who has left his home a
while that he may come back stored with new pictures and tales
of the life of other men. A steadfast home that he shall never
weary of, work that he shall never turn from in disgust, neighbours 
that never shame him with faces soured by injustice and
hopelessness; these are the surroundings that he shall look to art
to find for him, and if it be the art of his ideal, it will not fail him:
would not such things as these be worth buying at a heavy price?
or what price could buy them?</p>

<p>Indeed if ever such art as I am thinking of be gained by men
once more when they look back on anything which they have had
to sacrifice for it, they will think it little enough: but, to us
looking forward, and, many of us, thinking of art vaguely, looking
upon it as a pretty ornament which our lives may wear or not as
they think fit, and be none the worse if they refuse it: to us I say
who do not rightly know what art means, or have had [no] leisure
or opportunity to think what a dull blank the total loss of it would
make in all men’s lives, the necessary sacrifices to be made before
art can be born again might seem great and overgreat if we could
see them rightly all at once.</p>

<p>But let me say for myself, that I have now followed art for a
good many years and through all that time have more and more
directly set my face toward that ideal of art which I have been
speaking of, till it seems to me that I have gained some inkling of
what sacrifices must be made before art can become healthy and
progressive again.</p>

<p>My views if I stated them fully would seem to many here too
wild and eccentric to be even listened to, yet something I must at
least hint at, since it seems to me that the first sacrifice to be
made in favour of art is the pleasure of prophesying smooth
things to one’s friends and neighbours whose kindness one would
fain forebear to try by differing from them even a little.</p>

<p>I have said already that I durst not ask a man born to earning
weekly wages to sacrifice his ambition to rise out of his class:
what can I ask men to do who have little money and little leisure
to spare for any cause that does not seem very clear indeed to
them? Yet surely among such men the hope is not lacking nor the
effort to raise their whole class as a class, and by such efforts is art
more helped if we artists did but know it than by anything else
that is done in our days.</p>

<p>I have taken note of many strikes, and I must needs say without 
circumlocution that with many of these I have heartily sympathized: 
but when the day comes that there is a serious strike of
workmen against the poisoning of the air with smoke or the
waters with filth, I shall think that art is getting on indeed, and
that the schools of art have had a noble success: meanwhile I
fancy most of you will agree with me in thinking it a hopeful
token that all classes show signs of uniting to prevent the robbery
of commons which till quite lately has gone on unchecked in
England:<a href="#section10">[10]</a> the more individuals are kept in due order by the
public, the more public rights are respected the nearer grows our
chance of the new birth of popular art.</p>

<p>For the rest I might I know preach a sermon to my brethren of
the working classes on the benefit of thrift and sobriety and the
rest of it, but I am thinking that art and the love of art will one
day preach that sermon clearly enough to them so I had rather
say a few words to finish with to those of my own class, to the
rich and well-to-do, and the rather because, and it is a woeful
confession to have to make I know little of any class save my own.</p>

<p>Now then I will say what I have often said before, and shall go
on saying till there is no more need to say it: what I mean by art,
what I am really interested in, is not the prevalence of this or that
style, not the laying on the public taste whether it will or not a
law that such or such a thing must be done in art, not this
interests me, and forces me to speak when I had far rather hold
my peace; but rather a general love of beauty, partly for its own
sake, and because it is natural and right for the dwellers on the
beautiful earth to help and not to mar its beauty, and partly, yes
and chiefly, because that external beauty is a symbol of a decent
and reasonable life, is above all the token of what chiefly makes
life good and not evil, of joy in labour, in creation that is: and
this joy in labour, this evidence of man helping in the work of
creation, is I feel sure the thing which from the first all progress in
civilization has been aiming at: feed this inspiration and you feed
the flame of civilization throughout the world; extinguish it, and
civilization will die also: material prosperity, as they call it, that
is a thing, which according to our way of dealing with it will be
either the helpful servant or the cruel tyrant of civilization: are
you satisfied that it is still only our servant? If so bid it give back
to England the green fields which it has wasted, bid it turn its
terrible power to the task of giving us something worthy to supply
the place of the stored-up loveliness of ten centuries of which it
has robbed the homes of England: give it that command first, and
see if it will obey you, for there will be tasks heavy enough for it
when it has begun that.</p>

<p>And if you will find that it will not obey you, and that it is, as
indeed I fear, our master now, and not our servant, what shall we
do then? Two courses lie open to us; the first to sit down deedless, 
and pretend that we believe all is well and better, to let our
material prosperity drag us into deeds of injustice at home and
abroad: to destroy the prosperity both material and spiritual of
far-off countries in the name of civilization, while at home we
weakly try to palliate with our left hand the miseries we have
recklessly raised with our right: to sit still and feign content,
though we know that for all men day by day is less and less
leisure, more and more wearisome work unworthy of men; to
gather if we be rich some share of material prosperity to us,
making an island in the sea of squalor, and hoping at least that
we shall be eaten last or one of the last.</p>

<p>That is the one course open to us when we know that we have 
become the slaves of the tyrant we have made for ourselves: and
the other what is that? Daily and hourly resistance to our tyrant.
Ceaseless plotting of rebellion against him, till one day it breaks
out openly and reduces him to his old condition of servant
again: a heavy task you may say, even those of you who have
your eyes open, and know the monster which we have misnamed
commerce for what he is.</p>

<p>Indeed it is no light task, but I do believe that the heaviest part
of it lies in making up our minds that it has to be undertaken:
some ease and comfort the rebels of commerce will have to
sacrifice doubtless, and many things which men oftenest desire;
but of those many, most, will be found when we have lost them,
to have been but troublous hindrances to life.</p>

<p>Surely there are those who now desire money unreasonably
and who distress themselves (and their neighbours) very much
in the acquirement of it who strive for it for reasons which would
no longer exist if civilization should get into the right road again:
I know some of those reasons, of the nature of fencing oneself
against the intrusion of barbarous ugliness, or the desire for the
private possession of works of art. The time will come when no
one will need money for such purposes for ugliness in the work of
man’s hands, which is now the rule will exist no longer; when
there will be humble but satisfying art in private dwellings, and
lofty soul-inspiring art in public places, in short nature here
unspoiled, there helped in her loveliness about us on all hands.</p>

<p>Could any money buy that now? Still more could any money
buy the deep content of which it will be at once a token and a
cause, a content arising from a population employed in worthy
work, which will bring pleasure and sympathy for the worker in
him who uses it, pleasure and self-respect in him who makes it?</p>

<p>Compare that with the track of waste and squalor which the
misnamed monster Commerce leaves behind him now, and join
me I beg of you in hastening forward the day when the motto of
our country and of all countries shall be ‘one for all, and all for
one.’</p>

<p id="section1">[1] The text of this lecture is taken from B.M. Add. MS. 45332(3), which is entirely
in Morris’s hand. It was, apparently, delivered only once, on Dec. 12, 1882, before
the Leek School of ‘Art on the occasion of the annual distribution of prizes to the
students of that school. This lecture represents one of Morris’s first appearances
under the auspices of the national program of art education then known as “The
South Kensington System” (see Appendix I, 12-12-82, and Appendix II, item 34).
This title is written in pencil at the head of the first MS folio, but it is not in 
Morris’s hand. It may have been added by W. R. Lethaby who once was to edit
the unpublished lectures on art. Comparison of this title with samples of Lethaby’s
hand tends to confirm this.</p>

<p id="section2">[2] Six weeks before (see Appendix I, 10-20-82) Morris had addressed the 
promoters of the Manchester Fine Arts and Industrial Exhibition at a banquet
celebrating the exhibition’s opening.</p>


<p id="section3">[3] It seems unquestionable that the picture Morris describes here is “The Madonna
with the Chancellor Rolin” by Jan van Eyck, which was painted c. 1434-5. There
are however certain inaccuracies in Morris’s description that indicate that he
gepended wholly on memory for his facts. There is no indication that the
"woman” Morris mentions is sitting for her portrait; she is in fact the Virgin, and
she sits with the Christ Child in her lap. The “painter . . . serious of face” is the
Chancellor Rolin, who kneels in the left foreground with what appears to be a
book of hours before him. Finally, the islet seen through the arches is on the far
rather than the near side of the bridge. In all other details, including the placing
of the picture at the Louvre, Morris is correct. For reproductions of the painting
and a discussion of its dating, see Ludwig Baldass, Jan Van Eyck (London,
1052), pp. 55-57, plates 116-119 and frontispiece.</p>

<p id="section4">[4] Jan Van Eyck's "'burial fees were entered in the registers off the church of St 
Donatian at Bruges" on July 9, 1441 (<em>ibid.,</em> p.22).</p>

<p id="section5">[5] In the National Gallery, which fronts on Trafalgar Square, is displayed Jan Van
Eyck's Wedding Portrait of Giovanni Arnolfini,” dated 1434 (<em>ibid.,</em> pp.55,
72-176, plates 137—40).</p>

<p id="section6">[6] Arthur Penrhyn Stanley, Dean of Westminster and a fairly voluminous writer
(<em>The Life of Dr. Arnold</em> was perhaps his best-known work) had died in July,
1881. See R. E. Prothero, <em>The Life and Correspondence of Stanley, Late Dean of
Westminster</em>. 2 vols. (London, 1893.)</p>

<p id="section7">[7] The “plan” referred to here is the national program of art education then known
as the South Kensington System.</p>

<p id="section8">[8] This is the official title of the South Kensington System.</p>

<p id="section9">[9] All three of these cities are primarily important as manufacturing centers.
Burslem is a great pottery-manufacturing town; Widnes produces huge quantities
of soap; and Manchester—by far the largest of the three—is the center of the
textile industry.</p>

<p id="section9">[10] Morris was quite active at this time in the Commons Preservation Society, of
which George Shaw-Lefevre, M.P., was chairman. In the Society’s Reports of
Proceedings, 1876-80, Morris is listed on the General Committee.

At this point in the MS the words “or the heaping up of riches without regard
to the way in” are deleted.</p>
