<p>A meeting was held at Willis's Rooms, London, yesterday afternoon,
to promote the free navigation of the straits of the Dardanelles and to
protest against any attempt to maintain the present conditions affecting those
straits by the employment of military force.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="n1">1</a></sup></p> 

<p>[....]</p>


<p>Mr. Wm. Morris, who was described as the author of "The Earthly Paradise,"
wished the statement of the <em>Pall Mall Gazette,</em> that there was no war
party, was true. But it wee not true. The writer of the remark knew it was
not true and indeed there was a war-at-any-price party. (Hear, hear.) Who
were they? They were Liberals, living in the spirit of 1848, who believed in
the regeneration of the Ottoman Turk, and who wished to engage this country
on behalf of everything reactionary and of the success of absolutism over
peoples who had the right to rebel. Then there were the intellectual
reactionists, who were actuated by a hatred of anything high minded so
long as it was popular. Mr. Morris spoke of Mr. Gladstone as the noble man
who had thrown over prejudice. after prejudice at the bidding of justice
and truth, and this led to three cheers for Mr. Gladstone. The third section
of the war-at-any-price party (the speaker continued) was the Tory party
as a party. This war party knew that if war resulted home reforms would be
postponed, and reaction would flourish. To calls from the meeting to allude
to Mr. Roebuck and Mr. Cowen, Mr. Morris replied that he would go higher
than that, and say that the Court was throwing all the influence it possessed
(cries were raised. "Mr. Chairman, do you allow that;" "No Queen," and three
cheers were given for Her Majesty.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="n2">2</a></sup>)</p>

<p>The Chairman said the Sovereign's name should not be introduced.</p>

<p>Mr. Morris concluded by saying that the soul of the war party was Lord
Beaconsfield - a man without genius, but with a galvanic imitation of it.
(Uproar.) To that man, they must oppose the utmost resistance.</p>

<h3>Notes</h3> 

<p><a href="#n1" id="fn1">1</a>Morris wrote to his wife a few days later "you
will have got the newspapers by this time with a sort of report of our
proceedings including the speech of me, &amp; its â”€ may I call it amicable
indiscretion: of course I said much more, &amp; more connected words than that:
the little meeting was very noisy, but I call it a success considering the
slight care with which it was got up: at least it quite refused to cheer the Empress Brown: you see I had to speak at the end by wh: time the peace-party desired to fight for peace &amp; the war party was blue with rage."

<p><a href="#n2" id="fn2">2</a> Morris later repeated that this was not true:
"please to remember that the meeting did <em>not</em> cheer the Queen after
all" (<em>Collected Letters of William Morris</em>, Vol 1, No. 481)</p>
