every hour of his life.

‘MISERY AND THE WAY OUT
“War is the condition of Society under which we live? Is
it satisfactory, is it quite as we should all like it to be? Does
it quite please you who are listening to me, so that there is
nothing you want to alter in it?

“lf thatis the case, then none of my hearers are poor, and
none have any fear of becoming poor; I am speaking to a
crowd of rich men who are quite sure that they will always
be rich. Well I see thats not quite the case; some of us are
poor, some of us are afraid of becoming poor; some of us
have to do very unpleasant work; all of us have to work
‘more than we like; and we know of people who are worse off
in all these matters than we are: So we do want to alter
things if we could: we are not quite contented: if we say we
are, we are not speaking truly but say so because we don’t
‘want to argue, or because we want to get something out of
rich people whose interest itis that we should be contented.

‘Well Ishould wonder if we were contented; for when we
look at the present state of Society we find that the majority
of people have every reason to wish to be better off than

are, that in point of fact they are living in misery. Let
3k at the various conditions of life and see what
portion of the whole people has good reason to be pleased
with their share ofthe wealth, ease, good living, ina word,
the happiness of this most highly civilized country.

should think have a good right to be discontented: perhaps
you will say that they have made their bed and must lie in it,
that "tis their own faults; Iam not sure whether ’tis worth
while arguing on the matter, but I think I shall be able to
show later on that it is not their own faults as a class, that
their lives with all their horrible sufferings and still more
horrible degradation are made by the present state of So-
ciety, and are an essential part ofit

‘But letus leave them and goa step higher; let us look at
the condition of the lower order of labourers: those who live
most from hand to mouth, those who are themselves con-
scious of being sweated and oppressed and who cannot help
being conscious of it, including a vast number of poor wo-
men who have no protectors or bread-earners to help them
and are obliged to work for themselves without help, to
‘earn themselves such livelihood as they do earn. In London
at least well know of this class, and that itis not such a very
small one because it is always being recruited by those who
have been unsuccessful in various trades and livelihoods.
‘Well have these any reason to be discontented? I confess I
have never dared to myself to visit the homes of these poor
people though I have seen them in the streets and have
heard plenty about them: I know of them that they work
hard and very hard, that they live in daily fear of being de-
prived of that hard work miserably paid asitis: I know that
their houses, their clothes, their food, all are foul, wretched,
‘uunhuman, a shame even to think of. Well, is it their faults
that have brought them to this? Friends, there are not want-
ing people who will say, Yes it is their faults, thatif these
poor wretches had been (at what period of their poverty)
thrifty, provident, sober, courageous, they would not have
been in this condition: I say these people are liars: I use the

    

 

  

word in its fullest significance and say they are liars.
Granted that this class of the oor is recruited by
people who have made mistakes in life, or who are vicious

 

‘or whatever it may be called, we all know well enough that
asa class they have never had the chance offered to them of
150
being thrifty and provident: if a man of the well-to-do
classes is a drunkard or otherwise vicious does it necessarily
follow from his vice that he will become poor, or even poor
er than he otherwise would be? a very small acquaintance
with the modern scandalous chronicle will answer that
question. No, be sure that this class of poor wretches
who have such very good reason for being discontented
with the present conditions of Society isa necessary pro-
duct of that society and will only cease to exist when, it
does.

‘And now let us go a little higher yet, one step—not a
great one; and consider the condition of the ordinary la-
bourers, the unskilled, including in that class the ordinary
agricultural labourer. Shall we ask him to be contented? We
all know what his lot is; daily toil without hope: insufficient
coarse food: bad housing, no amusement, no pleasure
scarcely even of the most animal kind, no education; a
short life: if you think the last thing a blessing rather under
his circumstances, well and good, only remember it means
general ill-health while he does live: also I forgot, he has
one place of refuge before he reaches the last haven of rest,
and that refuge the workhouse, where he is looked on by
everybody including himself ata srt of criminal, Nay {
‘won't ask him to be contented. Well, and it is his fault also.
that he is in that position? I believe you will find people to
accert that als, and I wll waste no word in saying what I
think of chem. Again I assert that his life, his mise
anxiety and overwork rather, scarce worth calling ali Le
absolutely necesary tothe existence ofthe present sate of

‘ety: I tell you that, let him raise his class even but a
little out of its present horrible condition, and the founda-
tions of Society will be shaken.

“Again a step; this timea bigger one: we have got to the
skilled artisan. Surely he almost be contented with
ane ee

at, and having it ‘out to him in one
‘other that he is really quite a rich man; there he is with a
152

and ‘Trade Unions, money in the savings-bank, money in
building-societies; and in short able to [do] a great deal
more with (a precarious) say 38s. a week than I could do—
even if I were a conjuror: that's the view of him through
rose-colour glass: I can conceive an evil-disposed man, an
agitator say, looking at him through a medium less sweetly
pretty; and secing him to be overworked and not overpaid,
wretchedly housed, without intellectual amusement, his,
work mere drudgery, unhonoured, unrewarded; at best a
workman not a man, a machine that is, fed and housed and
tended asa machine's, that is to say, enough toenable [him]
to go on working for ever—No, not for ever: for please to
remember mhatever his wages may be, they are and must be
precarious, as too many of our countrymen are feeling at
the present moment: a change in machinery, a glut in the
market, and out into the streets he goes with plenty of lei
sure to study the average of wages: and what becomes of his,
money in the savings-bank, in the building-society? Nay
what becomes of his bits of sticks at home? Remember too
how hard he and his have fought to bring the wages up to
the point at which they are, to raise the standard of life
with him to what itis—such as itis. Remember that he has
done that for himself by combining with his fellows: think
iow pleased his employers would have been if they could
i cept that standard down! Why, they would have made

well, such as you are you have become by your discontent

present condition, and see nothing left to strive for but the

abolition of the House of Lords, I warn you you will not
keep it without fresh discontent, and ever fresh discontent.
Friends, you must battle to keep your present condition,
say, and in the course of that battle you will begin to see that
there are ever fresh things ahead for you to struggle for and
at last that itis all or nothing: believe me it will very soon be
ali then.

‘So far I have been going on one line and speaking of
those who earn their living by manual labour, by labour
which tries the bodily strength chiefly; but I cannot go fur-
ther without mentioning another class of workers, whose
work however it may enfeeble their bodies, does not strain
their muscles: the clerks and shop-assistants I mean; and I
think you will all agree with me in thinking that they at
least have some reasons for discontent: of course I am
speaking of the rank and file of them, and of them I will say
that they seem to me far worse off than the artisans: nomin-
ally they belong to the middle-class, but their earnings are
lower than those of artisans, and they are compelled to
make a show of gentility, save the mark, and moreover have
less hope of rising out of their misery, for indeed it is no
less, than an ordinary skilled workman at any rate; and
their position such as it is, is I should say even more pre-
carious than that of the artisans: it is strange however that
with such very solid reasons for discontent, the clerks as a
body are reactionary in their politics: I suppose it is their
‘very hopelessness which forces them to follow the politics
of their bosses: well, we cannot ask any individual of their
lass to run the risk of instant dismissal by overtacts of what
the said bosses would call rebellion: Ido call on them to
think about the matter, to cherish their discontent, to make
up their minds to the fact that they are in a wretched and.

they can to help us short of incurring the pain of dismissal:
‘we cannot do without them; taking the widest definition
of their class they area huge mass of men, unfitted by their
present slavery for most useful occupations, but not without

154

 

 

 
education: the very conditions, I say straightforwardly, for
turning men into revolutionists. ,

‘What other classes or groupsare there which have reason
for discontent with the present state of things? We are not
very far up the social ladder yet, I think there must be one or
two more: or what do [you] think of the pleasures ofthe life
of a small shop-keeper? His freedom from sordid anxiety,
his leisure; his plentiful opportunities for exercising his
body and improving his mind? You see he belongs to a
body of men whose occupation is undoubtedly doomed to
extinction: the great store, Whiteley’s or such like on the
‘one side, the Co-operative Store on the other, are drawing
nearer and nearer to the wretched small tradesman like the
two claws of a nutcracker, and day by day he is forced into
the ranks of the manual labourers or the servile army of
clerks. Once again I call on the small shopkeepers also, al-
though they may consider themselves to belong to the
middle-class, to join their most righteous discontent to the
discontent of the lower classes, in the full certainty that
nothing else will help them.

‘Higher yet: shall we speak of the farmers, whom also
the present system bears hardly enough on: I don't
‘sympathise with their troubles quite so much as I should
indeed if I could [put] out of my head the thought of the
lives their labourers lead; if I could forget the contrast be-
tween the jolly, well-fed burly farmer between 50 and 60

years old and his labourer, the miserable worn-out bow-

‘craviling old man of s0 or 60 who has helped him to

his burliness and jollity: still itis not to be denied that here

also the present system has done no marvels of prosperity:

here also among the farmers is plentiful cause for discon

tent: perhaps even among them we might win a few
recruits.

“Once more, how is it with the professional classes? the
noble class of hangers-on to which I myself belong? Here at
any rate I am at home, and I think I can tell you some-
thing about them. Well, perhaps we ought to be contented:

155

 
we are well clothed, well fed, well housed: we at least have
reaped the advantages of the progress of civilization: for us
perhaps education is more than a name: for us the standard
of intelligence has really been raised since the middle-ages:
it is we who in a sense rule our rulers, tell them what to
think, what to admire, how to express their thoughts, and
arrange their mandates into words which their slaves or
‘masters will listen to. For us the history of the world, the
memory of man, lies open; for us the course of nature, her
operations, and the hopes and fears to be deduced from
them, have been unveiled. Yes, our bodies and our minds
are both well cared for; there need be no limit to our aspira-
tions for the good opinion of our fellow-men while we live
and after we are dead: neither our anxieties nor our res-
ponsibilities should be crushing: even if our business ties
us to the filth and hubbub of a great town for the greatest
part of the year, we are almost all of us rich enough to be
able to rest ourselves by change of scene and the contem-
plation of the beauties of nature and art during some time
of the year: and when we are at work there is mostly with us
some interest in the work we have to do: not infrequently
indeed we have chosen our careers on those very grounds:
‘easy in our lives then, our minds expanded by education so
that we never lack amusement, and with more or less con-
genial employment, we at least are bound to be contented
whoever else above or below us are discontented.

‘Js it so indeed? yet here I'stand before you, one of the
‘most fortunate of this happy class, so steeped in discontent,
Bhat Ehave go weeds wick wil caper no went eae
i ee
‘ruin, prison, ora violent death. And I think you will believe
me when I say that my case is not so uncommon amon:
Hees ofny cian: tay the matics the SD Year
dress you are by no means all of them working-men,
Sepals al We pho afc ur thovenepaaeaa 2
and who work harder for the extinction of their class than
do. Well and why is this, what are our causes for discon

156

 
tent? It may well be that as a class we have none, but as
individuals you must remember that our position also is
precarious: for as some men may by dint of good luck, tire-
less industry and hardness of heart climb up out of their
class into ours: so it is by no means uncommon for some of
our class through it may be some softness or unfitness or
maybe through sheer ill luck to fall from our class into the
lower; which is then the very lowest class: I say straight
out that to my certain knowledge this is not uncommon.
The truth is we discontented ones of the intellectual or
hanger-on group are conscious that the whole thing is 2
desperate battle, and we are not contented to oppress those
below us as we must do under the present system, not only’
for the sake of keeping ourselves in our position but also
for the sake of piling up the monstrous fortunes of the rich
‘men whose hangers-on we are: whatever advantages we
possess over others we are willing and anxious to give up if
by so doing we can win a decent life for ourselves and for
others3a life from which the terrible element of precarious
ness should be absent: that is one thing but we may take
higher ground and say that all that civilization has culti-
vated our sensibility only to disappoint it, and that we suffer
(merely selfishly if you will) from the consciousness of the
mass of suffering and brutality which lies below our lucky
Fe btn, tir werd amie foe vane
short we see that that system which involves a desperate
struggle for bare lifein the lower classes, which condemns the
greater part of men to live alife unhappier than that of the
brutes, and little less brutal, and which forces us even to live
‘of fear and risk, can only lead the world towards
civilization ng itself; and I must tell you that
eee tosee this, and to ake moteof
the fact that our present system is eating its own heart out
by the visible ugliness and lack of dignity of all life under it:
we know enough of history to see that the dawn and pro-
{gress of our present system has gone hand in hand with the
sickness and continued sickness ofall beauty, all pleasure in
187

 

     
  

  

 

 
 

life: we see before us a great gulf gaping for the extinction
of all the hopes of civilization, and into which many
excellent things have already been swept; we see that noth-
ing can fill it up save a complete change in our system—
nothing save revolution; therefore we are discontented
and revolutionists!

“If these reasons are not enough for our discontent, Lean
give you none other: I can only say we are driven by dis-
Content and unhappiness into a longing for revolution: that
‘we are oppressed by the consciousness of the class of toiling
slaves below us, that we despise the class of idle slave-
‘owners above us, whose hangers-on we are: if you distrust
us because we are their hangers-on, at least make use of us
for the furtherance of the cause.

‘Now whether there are any discontented people above
this class of hangers-on to which I belong, doesn’t much
matter, because in number they do not amount tomuch: let
us call all such classes the contented classes; and indeed, asa
class I fear you must add my own hanger-on class, who are
only discontented so far as their position as guardians of the
morals and intellect of their richer masters forces them to be
more intellectually active than they.

“But for the others of those classes I have named I say
that they have a full call to be discontented, that in few
‘words they live in misery; yes even the better-off of them, so
dull their lives are, though they may scarce know it or feel

which is beautiful and might be full of pleasure.

‘And now comes the question, what hope of salvation
from this misery is there? for here at least if there is but a
glimmer of a hope will be pleasure, great enough sometimes
I think. Now the misery I have been speaking of is to a
great extent admitted by most people who give themselves
{hc trouble te think of uch matters bot much diveraey of
opinion there is as to the nature of the hope which may cast
a ray of sunlight on it: those who do not feel the misery in
their proper persons, and who venture to solace their not

‘very acute sorrow about other men’s troubles by indulging 1
in hope, have some of them a vague sort of idea that general
progress, the spread of liberal ideas, the growth of educa-
tion and the rest will little by little raise the condition of the
lower classes as they too truly call them: nor can I say that
they are wrong otherwise than in being vague; only if they
could but see into the matter and have a vision that was not
vague, of how that progress will work, I fear they would be
startled indeed and cry out, Nono, we didn’t mean that!
‘Then there are others of a sterner mould who have got i
volved in those lies about thrift and industry which I have
spoken of before, who will tell you that it is possible if not
easy forany working-man by practise of the said thrift and
industry to raise himself out of his class. Well of course that
is no answer to the question as to how the miserable classes
can escape from their misery; for tis quite clear thatif those
beautifully thrifty and industrious individuals can get out
of their class-wretchedness they must leave their class be~
hhind them; that in fact they rise at the cost of the mass of
their fellows whose average of thrift and industry chey
exceed.

‘Again I say that our friends the thrift-mongers when
they are not liars more or less unconsciously, are very vague,

‘members, isto stop: the fact is that under the system which
rrules us the general thrift ofa class will not in the least better

its capacity to live on less, its wages will be lowered and the
‘misery will still be there; clean misery, undrunken misery,
‘maybe, but misery all the same; an empty cupboard and an

‘whatever partial amelioration they have gained has been in
spite of the system, in its teeth; they have torn those ad-
vantages from the richer classes at their expense. Why, the

159

 

 

 

 

 

  
words are still ringing in my ears that our class, the middle
class, cast at the Trades Unions twenty years ago; some of
the younger of you perhaps scarcely remember the viru-
lence of the expressions of hatred that even would-be
Liberals allowed themselves to use against them—why? be-
cause we felt they were bettering their class at the expense
of ours: we are civil enough to them now; again why? Be-
cause of the progress of more liberal opinion among the
middle-classes?—no no no: because we feel that they have
gone the length of their tether and can gain nothing more
for their class at the expense of ours; their teeth are drawn,
weare no longer afraid of them.

“somuch want you to understand this point clearly that
I repeat it at the risk of wearying you: It is of the essence of
society as at present constituted, of society based on the
system of capital and wages that the wage-earners shall earn
no more than is necessary for them to sustain their power of
labour and reproduce their kind. Itis true that the standard,
of this subsistence varies somewhat: in times when com-
merce is brisk it will have a tendency to rise, in times when
things are slack it will fall; but up to a certain point, that of
independence of daily precarious, compulsory labour, it
‘cannot rise, and below the point of keeping men in tolerable
animal strength it cannot fall, although it has not seldom
come perilously near to that point. Our present society
therefore aed onthe perpetual servitudeand mice of
the wage-earning classes; any amelioration of that mi

“Now when you have fully got to comprehend this you
must as a matter of course see the futility of those

this must sound likea
‘cruel jest; but 'tis commonly said in so much good faith as a
person can have who half consciously deceives himself so
that he may dull the feeling of responsibility which would
‘otherwise trouble him: at the best, you see, and supposing
it true, those who console themselves with this vague com-
fort must make up their minds to wait generation after
generation, thousands of years I should say, before they
Can expect to see even the beginning of the end of poverty.
‘Well, such consolation as that joined to the comfortable as-
surance that at any rate it can’t be helped, that these things
simply come in the order of nature: all this I say may be
enough for smothering the pain which the rich suffer from
the misery of the poor: but for my part I dare not offer it to
the poor themselves: if I chought i true I should be very
careful to doall I could to keep a fine army and police made
le practically belonging to the middle-classes; I
re ree ene rest
ing so much even as to read and write: I think also I should
‘get people to preach to the poor and tell them that if they
‘only knew it they are better off than I am; that theirs is the
condition of happiness since they have nothing to lose;
that there is something holy and glorious in being weary,

irty, ignorant and hungry, and that when they die th
Oe
nothing to doy whereas I wen I die expect to go to
*tother place, and be eternally tormented. I think I should
feel also that this would be accepted as such a very likely
thing on the assumption that there is anything like justice
in the universe, that it would be hardly necessary to preach
any more morality to them: but perhaps sometimes when 1
was in a very cowardly mood and at the same time despii
the intellect of the poor especially, I should set to
telling them that I (the rich man) was very useful to them,
161

    

 

 

 
and provided them with work, and consequently victuals by
| the simple process of doing nothing and living luxuriously.
OF course I could not pretend to believe any of this myself,
but I repeat that if I were only careful enough about my
army and police and in withholding education from them, |
might be moderately comfortable a-nights and not dream
too much of being surrounded by a crowd of terrible beings
fierce-eyed and careless of anything but rapine, deaf to my
prayers for mercy, nay though they were called my coun-
trymen they would not talk the same tongue asa gentleman.

‘Well, you know this kind of solace to the rich for the.
griefof the poor has been tried long enough, nay stillis, and
even more than we middle-class people often think; because
in truth that other solace drawn from the figures of Mr
Giffen and such-like men that things are after improving, is
but an adjunct to the first solace; a kind of luxury of con-
science-stifiing; perhaps resorted to because a dim con-
sciousness is creeping over the rich that after all the condi-
tion of the poor may be a matter, ao in their own hands.

‘Yes, friends, that is the comfort, and the only one that I
‘can venture to offer to the poor for their share of the discon-
tent of modern Society; I say again their welfare lies in their
own hands if they only knew it. If you think of it, you must
see that on no other grounds could I venture to stand here
and remind you of how hardly the world uses you: ifit were
fociced tec that el thuie gronpeol people tec oped
were living in those varied degrees of misery, because the
eternal order of things must needs have it so, what could [
say save to bid you bear it as well as you could, and to hope
that there might be 2 heaven hereafter as there is full cer-

nly a hell here?

‘Friends, this earthly hell is not the ordinance of nature
but the manufacture of man; made I will believe not by
their malice but their stupidity; and it is your business to
destroy it: to destroy it, I say, not each man to try to climb
‘up out of it, as your thrift-teachers tell you, but to make an
end of itso that no one henceforth can ever fall into it. I say

162

 

 

 

 

 
again that is your business; and if you understood the mat-
ter rightly, you have no other business than that until you
have accomplished it.”

Tomit the rest, giving the passage which ends the lecture:

‘If we live to see the day when that slavery receives its
death wound we shall regret no labour or pain that we have
spent in the cause: no men that have ever lived will have
been so happy as we shall be. Big words, do you think? I
cannot help it, the cause is great too. Indeed sometimes
Thave heard it said, “the change you strive for is so prodi-
gious, so far transcending any revolution that has yet hap-
ened, that we dare not think about, it seems such an idle
jope.” Well, one might say, Don't think about it, then, but
act for it, and he who lives will see. But furthermore is it not
natural that the revolution we are looking for should be the
greatest of all? in these days when man's knowledge and
mastery over material nature has so increased, it might be
well expecced that not only the change in Society will be
tremendous when itis ripe for the change, but also that the
prize of the change should be proportionally great: I can
only say if that were not so, if in these days there were no
great ideal ahead of us, no hope for a life on earth better
than the world has yet seen, if the present condition of war
hypocritically veiled with a sham of peace is to go on for
ever, then all the promises and hopes of progress are mere
delusions and lies: then have we gained knowledge and
mastered the forces of nature that we might be more un-
happy than ever, and the future of the world is like to be
universal melancholy madness.
‘All which I know can't be true, I know that we are mov-
ing onward: everywhere we see the apathy of the last 2:
See engl iemtecaniecberne
‘as Mr Giffen says it is, that the condition of the workers is
‘improving, then so much the more hopeful is that discon
tent, because it proves that men are preparing to claim a
higher standard of life: and we call on them to raise that
163

   

 
 

standard ever higher, until they at last claim freedom with
no doubtful voice and are determined to be contented with
nothing less. It is to stir you up not to be contented with a
little that I am here to-night: you will not get the littleif you
are contented with it: you must be either slaves or free: you
are slaves at present: bear that always in mind, think of
what it means: try to think of the life you might live and
would naturally live if you were not forced into misery by
your masters, and then I do not think you can help com-
bining together to tell the world that you must be free and
happy: and then all will soon be won.”
