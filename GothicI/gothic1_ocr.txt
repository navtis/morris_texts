THE GOTHIC REVIVAL [I]'

By this name I understand all those attempts to break down
the slavery imposed on us first by the Italian Renaissance,
which at first was but little felt; partly because the traditions 
of the free art of the Middle Ages were still influencing
people’s minds, and partly because of the great mass of individual 
talent and genius which existed in the artists, the painters,
and the sculptors, of that exciting period, and which even yet
dazzles our eyes so much by its splendour, that we are scarce able
to look steadily enough at the condition of art and labour at the
time and see what was really going on: I say the slavery which
the days of the Renaissance brought on all labour was at first but
little felt in the arts; but as time went on, the mediaeval traditions 
of work died out, and very speedily too, and the genius of the
individual artists was buried in their graves, or flickered feebly in
certain narrow circles, and all that was left us of that wonderful
and much-behymned new birth was a caput mortuum of academical pedantry, 
which, looking down on the world from the
serene heights of cultivated stupidity, despised all genuine and
sincere attempts at the expression of the thought of man by means
of art, and above all despised the people, the true source of all art,
as of all wealth, as base mechanical drudges, and brute beasts just
good enough to wait upon their fellows for the hire of dog’s
wages.

It seems to me that any attack however feeble, from whatever
side, of however little importance in itself, on such a monstrous
and cowardly tyranny is worthy of our attention and sympathy:
but I think that before I have done with my subject I shall be
able to show that in spite of much ignorance and many fantastic
errors, in spite also of being directed on a side of human thought
which is somewhat at a discount at present, the intellectual Revolt 
known as the Gothic Revival was and is really connected
with the general progress of the world, with those aspirations
towards freedom, from which in truth no sincere art can ever be
dissociated.

Now it was the very essence of the academical pedantry to
which the Renaissance led, as its natural degradation, that it was
ignorant of real history: for it history fell asleep some time about
the death of Nero to awake in Italy in the days of Kaiser Maximilian: 
all that had gone before the days of Pericles was a vague,
ill-understood, empty dream; all that took place after the first
palmy days of the Roman empire was but a confused jostling of
barbarous peoples not worth looking at or considering. But the
intellectual revolt which I have to speak to you about was even in
its first days founded on an appreciation of the value of history;
that feeling grew as the revolt strengthened, until at last a new
science grew up, almost a new sense one may say, and real living
history became possible to us; not a dry string of annals, not a
mere series of brilliant essays or comparisons between the past
and the present; but a definite insight into the life of the bygone
ages founded on a laborious and patient sifting of truth from
hearsay; the story of the past I say became possible for us to read,
and we began to see why we [are] placed as we are [at] present,
and whitherward we are tending: and from thenceforward we
have not ventured to divide history into what is worthy and
worthless to know of; men we are, and all that men have done or
been is worthy our thought and study; even though we may be
the crown of all that has been hitherto, something will come after
us as something has gone before us, we are but a link in the
ever-moving chain of history that goes from the dusk into the
dark.

Well it is this new feeling for history which is almost as it were
a religion on which the Gothic Revival has from the first been
founded, and which it has itself in its turn done much to foster,
stimulating the research, and throwing new light on the discoveries 
of those who were more historians than artists: I shall
perhaps before I finish be able to point out to you more than one
way in which it has brought this about; but I must now definitely
address myself to the special task of the first of the two lectures I
have to deliver to you, which I think will chiefly be the sketching
for you some presentment of what the Gothic Art was, and how it
was related to the history of the world, before I can lay before
ou finally the results of the revolt against the academical stupidity 
of the 18th cent[ury]: and give you my poor opinion of what
its chances are in the future, and whether or not we may have to
dread for the 20th century a recurrence of that inane tyranny of
the 18th which our own time has at least felt uneasy under.
But before I go further I must ask you to understand that in
using the word Art, I am thinking of a wide subject and include
not only the lesser or architectural arts or those allied to industrialism 
but also at least all that side of literature which is born of 
fancy and imagination.

Now I have used the word Gothic Revival, and Gothic Art
without any hesitation; not only because the word has been for
long conventionally used to express that side of art and is now
generally understood, but also because though it was I suppose
originally used in a kind of good—humoured contempt it really 
expresses something of the history of the art in question, and that
too not its least important side: for whatever its origins were of  
which I must next speak, certain it is that that branch of the great
Germanic family whose isolated descendants have left behind us
at once the most romantic and the most dramatic record of its
morals, religion, and aspirations did set its seal upon it at least,
and that their spirit shows in it always, and makes it what it is.
But its origins are far enough removed from those kindred tribes
whose laws and manners, developed by their own necessities
apart from those of the older civilizations, forced it to take the
form which we now all know as Gothic: I will for the present set
aside the literary part of its development, the lines of which
became confused by pedantry even early in the Middle Ages at
the time when our own tongue became confused and to my mind
degraded as the result [of] our dealings in various ways with the
Latinized countries of the continent leaving these islands nothing
that had any unadulterated flavour of the soil save the fragmentary 
literature of Ireland and Wales, the oral tradition and ballads 
of Scotland and the northern border, and the fragments of
songs of the early Germanic invaders among which towers majestic 
the noble poem of Beowulf, unsurpassed for simplicity and
strength by any poem of our later tongue.

So now, as to the origins of Gothic art in its narrower sense,
that is to say of its Architecture with the accompanying arts, it is
of course obvious that it was born from that Roman architecture
which included in it the remains of Greek art, dealing with it
bowever in no sympathetic spirit; which Greek mask or outward,
ill-understood semblance overlaid an internal body of art deduced 
from the tribes of Italy by some process of which we know
nothing clearly; this body which, while Roman architecture still
remained classical, was little more than a habit of building was
the germ from which one side at least of Gothic architecture
sprang.: fmd the birth became visible just about the time when
the religion whose real aim was the worship of the great city as
the visible embodiment of irresist1ble authority, when the city-worship
of old Rome was fading out: Diocletian’s Palace at Spalato
gave the first sign that a new epoch of art was dawning on
far as anybody could have been from suspecting that
the last luxurious home of the Imperial tax-gatherer would date
the beginning of the freedom of art.

That I say was the first beginning the first glimmer of Gothic
Art: but it needed another influence to give it any reproductive
force; that influence had been preparing for ages past in Mesopotamia 
first, and then in Syria and Persia, and seems to have
already acted in its earliest times, superficially perhaps, on the
ornamental side of Greek Art: this art of Mesopotamian origin
changed by various circumstances as I say in Syria, and more still
in Persia where it was subjected to the influence of the ancient
and long-enduring religion of Zoroastrianism, did at last meet the
body of the Roman work set free from the subjection of Greek
ornament, and hieratic custom, and so long years after the death
of Diocletian, and when whatever there was of real power in the
empire had left Rome for Constantinople, and Greek was the
official language of the Roman empire—and so at Constantinople
produced what is generally called Byzantine Art, but which I will
call the first style of Gothic, because, then first was art set free
from the fetters of the long centuries of pedantry that followed
the crystallization of Greek art into the academical degradation
of what was once so vigorous and in most essentials so free. Now
you must understand that this Byzantine art as it is called which 
came to strangely sudden perfection in the days of Justinian, the 
builder of St. Sophia, had a reflex influence on the art of Italy, 
which also became Byzantine though with a difference: from the
two centres of old and new Rome it is not very difficult to trace 
the stream of art by means of the architectural monuments still 
left us, aided by some remains of the lesser arts if so one must call 
them, pre-eminent among which must be named, the important
one of calligraphy and painting in books, which has preserved for
us so much of the design and ideas of the Middle Ages which
would otherwise have been lost, I mean to say if we had had only
to depend upon the remains of the wall-paintings which once 
covered the interior of nearly every building in Europe. Well, by 
these means we can note that the Art of Byzantium proper on the
one hand much influenced by the kindred development of Persian Art 
spread all over the Mussulman East, producing everywhere an 
architecture of nearly complete unity of style which can
in fact otherwise only be named from the countries or among the
tribes where it is found, as Indian, Arab, and the like; for as to
Indian Art, outside the Brahman architecture which is a survival
of early Arian work obviously even amidst its lack of beauty akin
to that of Greece, and outside also Buddhist art, which takes the
impress in some places of other families of man who fell under
the sway of that great religion, there is no art peculiar to the
peninsula. While as to Arab art, except that the race has im-
pressed a sense of its turn for number, order, and repetition, a
sort of poetry of arithmetic upon the Byzantine-Persian ornament, 
which shows in its elaborate geometrical interlacements
and the like, except for this, there is no trace of any prepossession
towards any form of art among the Arab people.

So one may say that the first and most obvious branch of the
new Free Art is traceable in the Architecture of the Mussulman
East. The next, to make a long stride in place, is the art which
was taken, apparently directly from Byzantium, by the Germans
of the early Middle Ages, and by them carried all over northern,
non-Latin Europe, including England before the Norman Conquest, 
and the Scandinavian countries to a certain extent; although 
they were partly influenced by an older form of art, which
was probably pre-Arian, and certainly knew nothing of either old
or New Rome. This art has until touched by the Byzantine influence 
no capacity for the representation of natural form, and
seemingly no aspirations towards it; it is found unmixed chiefly in
Ireland, where in the elaborate pieces of calligraphy which the
monks of that country carried out were wrought for us monuments 
of an art as alien to the general feeling of Gothic as the
Arab interlacements: the patience and clearness of execution of
them is wonderful, nor do they lack a certain beauty, to a great
extent owing to the splendour and care of the actual writing:
otherwhere than in Ireland although this ornament has its influeénce 
not only in England, Scandinavia, and north Germany but
even, as far as book ornamentation is concerned in France and
Germany it is never found without a share of distinct Byzantine
art, which in the Scandinavian art mingles with it and changes it
Into a separate style, but in England and France is simply used
side by side with it without blending. There is no doubt in my
mind, by the way, that the restless trader-buccaneers of Scandinavia 
played a great part in spreading over North Europe the art of
Byzantium by direct transmission of wares; up to the time of the
Crusades they were always coming and going between their
northern home and Constantinople and gold coins have been
found in their hoards not only of those struck in that great city but
even by Mussulman Potentates: I may mention quite up to the
beginning of the 18th century the style clung to Iceland, embroideries 
are found there of that period which reproduce literally
the patterns of the 12th century, themselves little changed from
those of Justinian’s time. Even Germany was for long very conservative 
of the forms of Byzantine Art; in the buildings of the
North of the country the style exists very little changed, except as
it were involuntarily, it has gone clumsier and lost some of its
grace and beauty, and gained a little invention and some fantasticism 
and that is all. Even at Cologne whose Latin name and traditions 
might seem to account for the prevalence of a round-arched style 
amidst developed pointed architecture (for some at least of the 
fine churches of that city are no earlier than its French
Cathedral), even there the influence of actual Byzantine art is
obvious enough I cannot help thinking in St. Gereon. At any rate
Germany as a whole shows the direct influence of Byzantium
apart from that of old Rome, and it lasted much later there than in
other countries, till in fact it was swept away by the flood of b
Medieval Gothic, whose advent in Germany at least it seems
reasonable to connect with the rise and development of the craft
guilds, which just about that time were carrying the day, and organizing 
all labour under them.

But if it fared thus with the stream of art that crept from Byzantium 
over the northern parts of Europe, [which] had felt but 
little the rule of old Rome, it was quite different with that other
stream which coming from the Eternal City spread through Italy
and thence into south and north France, and so across the Channel 
with the Latinized Northmen of Duke William and our Angevin kings: 
this indeed was the true stream of Architectural art
(among Latinized peoples): let us look as briefly as possible at its
course and the other affluents that swelled it as Mediaeval Europe 
progressed towards the great change of the Renaissance. In
Italy itself it found itself in the South, in Sicily, in direct contact
with the Byzantine-Mussulman art, but never mingled with it; in
North Italy on the contrary it fell into the midst of an actual
Gothic people, and the spirit of the North at once seized on it and
gave it life, and working through the old Roman forms produced
some of the most beautiful buildings which the world has ever
seen: but as with this Lombard architecture Gothic architecture
in Italy waned I will just note the fact here; asking you, if you
doubt it, to compare the two churches at Verona, St. Zeno and St.
Anastasia: the first is round-arched, the second pointed, and
therefore formally Gothic: nevertheless St. Zeno is undoubtedly
in all essential respects far more Gothic; St. Anastasia being really
a classical building masquerading in Gothic: the fact is that
except for this Lombard enthusiasm, the forms at least of the
actual classical Roman architecture were always in Italy ready to
spring up into life: before I leave the whole subject I hope to be
able to show you what the Renaissance of the 16th century was,
and I do not mean to say that this love for the old classical forms
was a strong motive power in bringing about the change which
was much deeper than that, but when the spirit of change was
ready and urged people towards taking up the past again the
forms already sympathetic to it lay ready to hand.

Well the Roman branch of the Byzantine stream spread as I
said through Italy and so into France, in the south of which
country was developed a very handsome, dignified style having
little in common with the elegance of the architecture which
flowed from Justinian’s Constantinople: it was in fact almost
purely Roman, but Roman set free, you understand from the
affectation of imitating Greek Art: many most stately buildings
are left us of this South-French-Romanesque, but alas most commonly 
sadly damaged by restoration; in some cases pretty much
destroyed by it.

In the north of France the direct Roman influence is still plain
enough; but there comes in again I fancy some of the feeling
imported by the Northmen whose art, what they had of it, was as
I have said directly taken from Byzantium: anyhow there is no
doubt that the Gothic style which both there and in this country
we not very inaccurately call Norman can by no means be considered 
a pure development of the Roman architecture; it is certainly 
influenced by the actual Byzantine feeling as the Lombard
work is, but probably adds to that some borrowings from that
early pre-Arian art of which I said that in some forms there was
direct importation into France from Ireland, but which also, I
repeat, is to my mind due at least partially to those Northmen
whose name the style bears.

It remains to state definitely of this early Gothic style, what I 
have already hinted, that this Norman, or Franco-Norse Romanesque 
architecture did after the Conquest of Duke William entirely 
supersede the native English Romanesque, which undoubtedly 
had been developed partly from sheer rude imitation by the 
English of the mingled Roman-Byzantine and the pure-Byzantine, 
and partly from art imported from Germany, where as
aforesaid the Constantinopolitan style was in use simply.

Thus far therefore we have gone towards the development o
Cothic architecture: at the time where we are now making
pause there is a round-arched style in use all over Europe in
[some] countries developed from the Roman Byzantine influenced 
here and there by the Romanized civilization of the imperial 
provinces, partly by the barbarous art (I use the word in no
derogatory sense) of the pre-Arian time or at least pre-Germanic
time: in other countries the style is developed more directly from
the actual Byzantine of New Rome, and is altered by nothing
more than the rudeness of the imitators and a not very strong
strain of the above-said early European art. This is the first stage
of actual Gothic Art, the time of the supremacy of unmixed
Feudalism.

But now when this Romanesque style was fully developed
came another element of change and the Gothic art of Europe
was acted on by the brilliant but less intellectual art of the East
which like so much of Gothic had its origin chiefly in Justinian’s
Constantinople. The cause of this new element, the presence of
which is undoubted, is generally supposed to be the Crusades:
but I doubt that their direct influence has been exaggerated: you
see besides the fact that as time went on the art of Constantinople 
and the Greek Empire generally was falling more and more
under the influence of Eastern art; there were all this time two
points of Europe where that art existed in its completeness, Spain
and Sicily to wit. Now you must remember that grand as the
building art was in many parts of Europe before the 12th century,
the other industrial arts were in a rude state even as to matters of
ornament: the art of figure-weaving in N[orthern] Europe for
instance was confined to actual tapestry, and a rude kind of
figured cloth which is still woven in the Abruzzi in Italy, and in
Iceland: whereas in Greece, Syria, Sicily, Egypt, and Spain, the
art of figure-weaving as we now mean the word was thoroughly
well understood and skillfully practiced: the woven goods made
in these countries especially in Sicily, were widely sold all over
Europe, and must have done much to influence the general character 
of mediaeval ornament; which for the rest was easy to
influence at this period; for at the time of which we are now
speaking, the end of the 13th or beginning of the 14th century
there was a remarkable unity in the styles of the whole civilized
world: you can indeed easily tell where such and such a piece of
work was done, in England, France, Italy, or Persia, but the
resemblance, or rather the sympathy of ideas will strike you much
more,

Thus we have reached the time of the fully developed Gothic
art, which indeed seems by this time according to the natural law
3 of growth to have gone so far from its originals as to have become
another thing, but in which notwithstanding every germ of the
older art is visible to the seeker. Now before we proceed to the
Somewhat melancholy task of considering its fall and change, I
will ask [you] to consider the nature of this art, which wrapped in
its folds all Europe and much of Asia creating such a body of 
beauty on the earth as has not been seen before or since. 

Now the very essence of its beauty was that it was founded on 
reasons no one can doubt that, whatever was the quality of the
civilization of those days, men in their buildings for instance built
what they wanted, what that civilization called for: no circumstances 
were really adverse to this elastic, intelligent, and free
art: on the contrary the circumstances were used whatever they
were for the advantage of the art: once more consider the buildings 
of the complete period and note how they used their materials, 
driven as they were by the want of each communication to
make the most of what came readiest to hand: granite, freestone, 
brick, rubble, wood, plaster, the style creeps round each and fits
it like a glove: nor was it only in the building art that this law of
reasonable liberty inspired the arts, this knowledge of necessity
defined by a philosopher as being the only true liberty: through
all details down to the smallest it passes: take for instance the 
surtace ornament of the Gothic times: no designers ever understood 
better the necessity of mystery in pattern designing; but
this mystery they well understood was not to be attained at the
expenses of clear and definite meaning; all growth must be capable 
of explanation logical and clear: all outlines must be clean
and sharp; if you go wrong you will be found out at once;
colour must be bright and clean, it must be absolutely good, no
negation of evil qualities will serve your turn.

Now of the causes of all this I will speak later on: at present I
will but note that so it is, that the Gothic is above all other
intelligent, reasonable, and free. Furthermore it was, as I have
already hinted universal: I have said that the industrial arts were
in a rude condition in N[orthern] Europe at the beginning of
period; of course comparatively to our times or times earlier than
ours that was more or less the case all through the middle ages:
nevertheless rude as the technique of some of the arts was (pottery 
for instance) there was nothing either coarse or careless
about their artistic qualities: it is doubtless a fact that the
furniture and appointments of a 14th century house were not up to our
standard of luxury, their household goods were few and simple:
some people consider this a disadvantage, and call it a state of
barbarism; I do not — but — however let all that pass at present;
the point to which I wish to draw your attention is this, that
scanty as the furniture of a mediaeval house might have been,
and rude as some of it may have been every piece of it was
properly made and properly ornamented, that is, was beautiful.

I will ask you to consider this fact and contrast it with the
present state of things when you have the arts in your mind as a
matter of history; everything made by any common artificer was
naturally and without effort beautiful, just as the works of nature
are beautiful without effort and though you don’t notice them,
thinking they were made for the convenience of your table or bed
or what not. I say just think of that, and what a different world it
was then from what it is now.

Now further this Gothic art had another characteristic which I
suppose always accompanies great art: it was progressive, confident, 
intolerant, though there was history in every atom of it, it
was not conscious of it, was conscious only of exultation in the
present and hope for the future; that was the spirit of it as far as
the mere art was concerned; otherwise deep in its soul was the
melancholy of the North and its sentiment; but what of regret for
past times lay in it regarded [not] the art of past times, but the
life of the former generations gone like the leaves of the autumn
trees, and such lives they really figured to themselves as differing
no ways from their own. Now as there was in it some melancholy
and abundant sentiment, so also there was no stint of humour:
that liberty or knowledge of necessity which was the mainspring
of it insured that: rough but kindly humour is an essential part of
all the Gothic of the Nlorth] at least; a wish to scare nobody
away .by contempt or pride, a feeling as near as may [be] the
opposite of that which is the motive feeling of the pedantic art of
the Renaissance. Here then we have the characteristics of Gothic
Art: It was common to the whole people; it was free, progressive,
hopefu1, full of human sentiment and humour: such as this it
lasted with some gains perhaps in certain directions, but with
more losses, till the end of the 15th century: but with the beginning 
of the 16th came the change. It was not only that the
popular art grew poorer, coarser, and more meagre, though that 
happened and for very good reasons, I think, but on the top of
this coarsened and worsened popular art was thrust another art;
produced by men who had gained a little more knowledge than
the naif workmen of the 14th century, and with that had gained
some feeling for history: which feeling was united to overweening 
hopes of the speedy progress of the human race which had
taken hold on people’s minds owing to events, talk about which I
must again defer till my sketch-story of the arts is done. The
knowledge and the hope together of these men of the Renaissance 
bred in them an absurd contempt of the just-past pure
mediaeval times, and in the arts the result of that contempt was
that for the first time since art began, men looked backward for
their ideal of beauty and fitness, and culled from past times what
they thought could by some means or another be united to the
life of the present and palliate more or less the regrettable barbarism 
of the work which they were still obliged to use in a mechanical way: 
thus as far as the arts were concerned and especially
architectural arts they were no longer men living an eager and
hopeful life producing beauty to show their pleasure in that life;
but scholars sitting under the rod of a pedant, whose teaching
they but half understood as they wrought anxiously to carry out
his lightest precepts. Such I say were the men of the Renaissance
and art which had been free for 800 years fell into slavery again, a
slavery far darker and less hopeful than that from which it escaped
at the period of the fall of the Roman Empire. It is true indeed
that this fall in art was quite hidden from men’s eyes at the time
nay they called it a new birth, not a death sickness as they should
have done: for at the head of the great impulse towards change
and knowledge was a mass of talent and genius composed of some
of the most gifted men the world has ever seen, the blossom of all
those centuries of free art which had gone before them: the work
of their strenuous individual genius was so brilliant and entrancing 
that it has quite hid from many of us even at the present day
the sickness of all that side of art which depended not on individual 
genius but on collective genius or tradition; all that great
mass of art in short which we now justly call popular, or the art of
the people: while those great men of the Renaissance lived this
was not obvious partly as I say because the splendour of their
talent hid it and partly because the degeneration was but beginning 
in their time: but when they passed away, they left behind
them as far as the individualist arts are concerned a mere <em>caput
mortuum</em> of academical whims and pretences, a so-called art
which prided itself on being exclusive, narrow, and uninteresting: 
and as to the arts of the people, they had become in countries 
where art had flourished most, as in Ttaly, a kind of necessarily 
tolerated appendage to intellectual art, in short to make my
meaning plain in few words the flunky of intellectual, or rather I
should say of academical art: they had become upholstery.
Meantime in less artistic, and cultivated countries all pretence
even of intellectual art had disappeared, but though popular art
had fallen very low, it did not altogether fall into upholstery
though [in] the last half of the 16th and the first half of the 17th
[century] social and economical causes had indeed deprived it of
its dignity a'nd thoughtfulness, but tradition still clung to it, and
even mere ignorance and clumsiness aided it to shake off to a
certain extent the fetters which academical art imported from
Italy w?uld have laid upon it: the result of all this was that mass
of architecture of which a good deal is still left us in our own
country under the name of Elizabethan and Jacobean
which brightens and makes historical many a humble landscape in England,
and which even behind the quaint affectation of stilted
pomp and would-be learning which not seldom oppresses it has a
homrliness and love of life which makes it pleasant and human
and even in a sense beautiful: it will not bear criticism but it
forces us to love it in spite of all defects. But you must always
keep in mind that it is not its super-imposed defects that make it
lovable but the tradition still lingering in it which has remained
tom the times of art which produced work at once logical and
beautiful: it is not the Renaissance form which we love in it, but
the Gothic spirit,

Think of the different way in which we look on a Renaissance
building in Italy and in England: compare one of our old Warwickshire 
houses with an Italian building of the same style: the
latter is twenty times more carefully designed, has much more
pretension to be considered a work of art, and as to execution of 
details, of course there is no comparison between the two: yet
you hate the Italian building and love the English; and really
because the first is academical, pedantic, the second human: the
faults of the English building come from mere ignorance and
lumpishness, but those of the Italian from malice prepense: and 
all this difference I say means that some Gothic or human feeling
still remains hidden under all its stiff-necked follies in the English
building, so that it gives us at least abundant excuse for loving it.

Well, this semi-Gothic feeling lasted in pretty abundant measure 
with us till the middle of the 17th century, but in out-of-the
way corners of the country [it] lingered much later. For the rest
the flood of civilization swept over us and steadily swamped what
was left of Gothic feeling even in England, and the 18th century
saw the final degradation of the arts as genuine spontaneous
expression of men’s thoughts and pleasures. Thencefor[war]d
throughout the century decade after decade architecture grew
more pinched, miserable, and ungenerous till it sunk at last int
the box of bricks with the slated lid of the beginning of this
cent[ury] which was I fear only too typical a habitation for the
mercantile person who lived in it with his poor, limited, grov -....fj
ling life. The lesser arts went the same road, whatever was natura
or instinct with pleasure or intelligence faded out from them, anc
ornament became the mere slave of fashion a foolish, indefe
ble, inexplicable habit. Meantime England was as to the intellec
tual arts now going on an equal footing with Italy and thy

English school of painting must I suppose be considered the glor
of the 18th century in that line: well I am bound to admit th
cleverness, readiness and confidence of it, but I will admit n
further good qualities [in] it: I call upon you for instance to sh
off the bondage of sham admiration, and tell me what it is furthe
than these qualities of cleverness, readiness, and confidence tha
you really like in the acres of canvas covered by Sir Joshu

Reynolds, and on which such floods of adulation have been and I
fear will be lavished: I ask you to look at them with your own
eyes and not through those of art critics and tell me what you see
in them; in that regiment presentation of the dullest men ever
born, and the plainest women the world has ever seen whom not
even the flattery of the courtly painter could turn into anything
else than the simpering, vulgar fine ladies that they were: and all
this smoothed down with a commercial conventionality just fit for
the period which was bringing to birth the final triumph of
commerce and saw nothing beyond it, no glimmer of the change’
which I fervently hope is now on the way.
. Nor can I pass by quite unnoticed the literature of this period
of slavery, all the more as the revolt against it was first felt in
literature: of that we must say that it entirely lacks all imagina-
tive qualities, has in it in fact nothing save that cleverness, readi-
ness, and confidence which I have admitted to be possessed by

ainting: not only does poetr
seem dead in the 18th century, E))ut if é;ou atteglpt topwadz
through the books of verses of the time which insult the name of
poetry, you find that even the commonplace English of the time
was too romantic to satisfy the writer’s hatred of imagination and
humanity, and that he has been obliged to invent a new language
which can barely be understood without a dictionary by us of the

-~ 19th century.

Here we are landed then in that prim and dull country of the
18th century where we no longer dare to call our souls our own:
e is studied only for the purpose of insulting the
fellglon and aspirations of those who went before us and of
magnifying our own mean and hypocritical sham virtues: where

‘ poetry is come to mean copies of smooth verses with as little
» meafllng as can be got into them and without any glimmer of
Passion or imagination, where art finally is on the one hand a
PfldStlme of dilettanti, and on the other foolish upholstery pro-
'7"1 ed by despised drudges for vulgar luxury. We have gone a

 

 

‘change.”

long and weary way certainly from Ely Cathedral to Gower St..1
from Giotto™ to Joshua Reynolds, from Beowulf to the Rape of |

the Lock. That strange force which for lack of a better word I,A
suppose we hapless mortals call civilization has played us a}l
scurvy trick certainly leading us on with numberless hopes till as
I say it has landed us at the end of the 18th century stripped of{,
all art and poetry that is to say of all the pleasure of life: with
history a despised desert behind us, with a blank prospect of
mere utilitarianism before us.

Nevertheless out of the midst of this dreariness came that:
intellectual Rebellion, which I have ventured to call the Gothi c
Revival, and which in spite of all the follies and illogicalities that
have clung to it, has it seems to me been founded on reality, and.
is in fact part of that great change from the mere commercial
period to something better and higher, which is verily going o‘_
but which in its fulness is but rarely recognized as yet. 4

I will finish what I have to say tonight by laying before you a:
very brief sketch of the beginnings of this revolt, leaving for my
next lecture an account of the results of it in the art of the present
day together with my estimate of its real value as a factor in the
hopes of raising the general standard of life which we of thes
days cannot fail to entertain.

Now I hope that you will not think that my protest against the

of the extreme lack of imagination in the design of contemporary buildings. Part—,‘l
the present Borough of Holborn-St. Pancras, this street borders one side of th
British Museum and separates the University College from the Medical S hoc
In the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century it was the site of a num
of building projects whose most significant characteristics were uniformity
plainness, all the houses being built with “stock brick facings, plain parap:
and slate-covered mansard roofs. . . .” See J. R. Howard Roberts and We

favorite pre-Raphaelite painters, not only because he was a pre-Raphaelite, b
also because he combined in his work the mystical aura of his religious subje
matter and the precise eye for composition and detail ordinarily associated wi
architecture. He was himself the official architect of Florence in the last years
his life, designing during that period the campanile and the facade of t
Cathedral. See [Margaret O.] Oliphant, The Makers of Florence (London, 187 6.

pride of pedantry which from the first was an essential part of the
Renaissance and in the end made it merely contemptible indi-
cates on my part any foolish hostility towards real knowledge
towards real science, all genuine professors of which must surel):
have a due share of humility if that is true, as I believe it is
which I have seen written that however science may progress thej
amount of what is unknown will always be infinitely more ;han
that which is known.

At any rate I am so little swayed by any disregard of science
that I must assert as I hinted above that whatever stirring has
been among the dry bones of the 18th century began from some

. inspiration of historical science: and first of all on the side of

language: till the time of the great philologers of the end of the
18th century the impression on the minds of scholars was that
whereas Greek and Latin were languages possessing definite
grammar all other tongues spoken were but such arbitrary acci-
dental jargons as might have been expected from the rude bar-
barians who spoke them: but the philological scholars I am think-
ing of found out that this was far from being the case, and
discovered the true relations of one tongue to another, a;ld so
demonstrated the unity of man: in the course of which study they

also discovered the literary merits of the non-classical poems and

other literature; nor only so, but also learned from them much as

- to the history and social conditions of the earlier nations which
- could have been learned from no other source, so that even the

earliest of our ancestors became visible to us no longer as esurient

! Sword-wielding machines but men of like passions to ourselves,

bound together by the ties of Society, living under laws which
n;)t even tl.le mighty power of Rome could destroy, but which
%ayed their part in the formation of the Society of Medieval

urope, now seen to be a far different thing from the jarring of

e;u}:s and kl'pgs, the hubbub of a set of violent men accidentally
Pitch-forked into positions of rule over their fellows.

f }11&11 th.ls was the beginning of the modern study of history by
: r;)se hgh.t we not only saw something of what our own ances-
. thWere like, but also and more easily were able to put ourselves
y the pl.aces of the. great peoples of antiquity, and sympathize

their real feelings instead of ignorantly’worshipping them

from without as the Renaissance pedants had been content to do. -
It is clear that imaginative literature could not sit quietly by
while historical research was providing her with so large a mass -
of material; and accordingly from this time poetry to use the
word in its largest sense, was born again, and the school of what}}
for want of a better word I am compelled to call the Romantic
writers arose. I have said it was a long and weary way between -
the ancient poets of our race and the elaborate trifler Pope; but
Coleridge and Keats and Shelley and Byron claim brotherhood -
not only with Shakespeare and Spenser, nay not only with Chau-
cer or even William Langland, but yet more perhaps with tha :
forgotten man who sang of the meeting of the fallow blades at
Brunnanburg, or who told of the old hero’s death in the lair of the
gold-guarding dragon; or he who bewailed the ruin of the ancient
city, or he who sang so touchingly of the friendless, lonely man
the Wanderer. 4
And now as a last word for tonight, consider the attitude of
three men of that time as showing that the revolt against the old
pedantry was undoubted at the same time it was with some at
least unconscious: consider then Byron, Keats, and Scott as an
illustration: the first praising Pope making a god of him almos ;
and yet writing always in hot revolt among the Romancists; the
second so completely cut off from what was left even then of he
old pedantic twaddle, so condemned then (even by Byron by the
way) so completely accepted now: and the third worth consid
ing yet more as being so closely connected both with history a
Gothic art: for he like Byron, still felt himself bound to affec
enthusiasm for the false civilization of his own day, or even wa
really touched by it somewhat; is always excusing Gothic life
architecture for its barbarism though he was clear in his ow
mind that it was that which he really liked; so strong you see wa
even the Renaissance pride of pedantry that it fettered Byron
rebellious mind; made the sweetness and passion of Keats seer
nought to his contemporaries, and befogged the strong, manl
spirit of Scott.
Here then for tonight we will leave it.** It was the product &

first of a strenuous and exciting epoch, it was agitated by the rise
of commercialism, made eager by the discoveries of past history
and of rising science; but it joined to that life and eagerness e;
tyranny arising from the beginning of the strongest and comple-
test rule of the weak over the strong that the world has yet seen
the plutocracy namely of the middle classes: which tyranny it
backed with an hypocrisy which made it ungenuine and unhu-
man: which in Catholic countries took the form of pure materi-
alistic cynicism masquerading in priests’ garments; and in protes-
tant of a religion made for the rich which proclaimed competition
for a good position in this world and the next as the real rule of

_conduct. Such was the Renaissance in its first days, splendid

amidst its tyranny, hypocrisy, and lack of hope: but at the time I
have now brought you to its splendour was long gone, of its
tyranny was left only the narrowness and primness which was the
due accompaniment to its ever-increasing hypocrisy, the favour-

 ite vice of the bourgeoisie grown moral whom it had now mainly

to depend upon for its support: it only existed because there was
nothing better to take its place: but surely it seemed as if that
better thing was coming; for its dulness now began to be illumi-
nated by flashes of genius as strong and real as that of the time
before the first days of that tyrannous Renaissance.

What that better thing turned out to be; what may yet come
from it; whether it is the glimmer of real daylight, or the false
dawn of a cold moon—all this I will ask you to consider in my

1The text of this lecture is taken from B.M. Add. MS. 43331(10), which is
entirely in Morris’s hand. It was apparently delivered only once, on March 3, 1884
(see Appendix I, 3-3-84), to The Birmingham and Midland Institute in Birming-
ham. One week later (see Appendix I, 3-10-84) the second part of the two was
delivered to the same audience.

Although a small portion of this lecture has been published in Artist, Writer,
Socialist (11, 629-30), it seems proper for several reasons to include the entire text
here (see Appendix II, items 44 and 45).
