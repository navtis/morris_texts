NOTTINGHAM KYRLE SOCIETY, 1881
I FEEL rather shy and timid at having to speak to the

Citizens of this ancient and famous City, Ta Londoner,

of subjeéts which to say the truth London does not un-
derstand very well itself: but the truth is that such great
centres of labour as this city is have great advantages over

197

 
the overgrown country of bricks and mortar called London,

nd so far from my having any particular hope that London,
will move them, what I really look for is that they will move
London: for whatever other interest may attach to them,
doubtful or not, they claim our undoubted interest in one
respeét—that they make something.

(Hetehe tells tory about Cobbler at Cheiter}

Well, as I turned away from my acquaintance I fell a-
thinking of the ways of great towns, & before I had got to
the next gate of the ancient walls, I was thinking more of
London than Chester; and came to the conclusion that we
Cockneys also must say of ourselves that a great part of our
business was living on one another: and that in that respeét
we were ata disadvantage as compared with the dwellers in
towns whose chief business was doing something, making
tangible wares: goods, as our tongue still expressively calls,
them. London is the counting-house; Nottingham and its
sistersare the workshops; and 1 who am a workman can-
not help being more interested in the workshops than the
counting-house: and at any rate my hope, my reasonable
hope Iwill call it,is that the workshops of England will help
1us peopleof the counting-housetto livealittle more decently.
than we have been doing of late, and even in a steady and
friendly way to compel us to doso.

T have said elsewhere, and I shall never lose an oppor-
tunity of repeating it, that whatever hope weartists of these
latter days have for the future of art rests on those who have
to do with making things. People who have the unhappi-
Hen © lie yaa lives and take their Ger ouiiage

ranted, who look upon art asa kind of superstition of civi-
ization, a sort of magic growth of certain morbid intel-
Jeéts: these can't help us: their praise or blame is equally
useless to us; I think their very money when we get it turns
to dead leaves or slate stones like the ill-gotten gold of fai
Stories. Depend upon it, art, which is the very highest ofall
realities, the explanation of the depth of them, can only be

realities; men whose honour and comfort, nay, their daily |
bread depends upon their looking keenly into the nature of
things; whose praétical knowledge gives them aright to say
‘when they look at things fashioned by man, this is genuii
well made—pood: this is pretentious, ill-made—false.

‘These are the people to whom I feel sure the art of to-day
must appeal. There are many grades among them: they in-
clude men of the highest cultivation, of the greatest powers
both intellectual and material. But I shall not be likely to of-
fendanyone here, I think, by reminding you that the whole
class of those who make anything is founded on that great
mass of people whose very hands make them, called in the
slang of to-day, the working classes: surely "tis to these that
the ultimate appeal must be made, in artas in other matters.
If they will not have art, we the cultivated and rich people
cannot have it: if they cannot have it, if our social system.
forbids it to them, be sure that the day is not far distant
‘when the cultivated part of our society will refuse art also,
‘will have grown utterly blind to it.

I cannot believe such a misery possible: for I do think
that people of all classes will unite to prevent its falling on
the world. Yet if they were not to do so, such an end would
not only be possible but certain: to help forward the or-
getziog ofall thought people to rest ach a return to

rbarism, nay, toa state of degradation far worse than bar-
barism, for that was hopefuul—is not this a worthy end and
aim? That and no other I believe to be the end and aim of
the Kyrle Society: and it begins by striving to show the
working classes that there is such a thing as art and that it
is for them as well as for their richer fellows to enlist their
‘good-will in favour of art, thatis in favour of the aspirations
and, ‘of the race towards perfection.

small things, for what we all admit are small beginnings;
butas you know well all great things may grow froma small

And though the Kyrle Society be not what is usually
called an artistic Society, though itsaimsare not art merely,
et I say that all artists owe it a debt of gratitude for begin-
ing at the right end. True we have all of us heard discus
sions as to whether art should be for art’s sake, should itself
be its own end, or be done for a purpose—most fruitless
discussions they are, I must say, mere confusion of words.
You may be sure both that areal artist does his work becatise
he likes it, and that when done ’tis a blessing to his fellows.

If I had been Robinson Crusoe and had had the courage
and patience to make those beautiful pots of which we all
read with such pleasure, to be gure I would have managed
to have painted or scratched something on them. No true
sailor should I have been if I had not somehow got my polly
on them and my dog and my cat, and some hint of my im-
penetrable wood: yet whiles be sure I should have sighed
heavily enough to think that there was nobody by me that
could share my pleasure and half understand my conceit in
the work of my own hands:and whiles I should have dream-
ed that one day people in England might get hold of my
handiwork and nudge one another as they said, Look what
the poor devil did alone on his desert island, isn’t it clever?
‘That’ theway to draw acatwithasharp ikon damp clay.

Every work of art is both a good thing in itself though
nobody sees it, and if seen will influence themindsand lives
‘of men, and lead to other things scarce guessed at by those
who wrought it. Ther no market in the world where
selfish art can be bought: the thing doesn’t exist. You may
eal art, or oppress people in order to get it: the worse for

rou and those that come after you; for nature will revenge
Terself on swindling and oppression: but don’t call art
thiefand a tyrant because you area thiefand a tyrant; that
is a mere confusion of ideas.

Yet though all true artists are benefactors to their race,
and increase the wealth of the world: yet those serveartand
the world well who both see clearly that healthy art must be
shared by all, and direétly and in theirown day in the face of

200

  

   

 

 

  
 

all discouragement set to work to bring about equality of
this blessing as far as is possible and natural: this is what
the founders of the Kyrle Society have done in the most
unobtrusive manner and yet I think with no small share of
success considering the huge difficulties in the way of even
beginning anything with real hope.

T have said that art to have any hope for the future must
enlist on its side the good will of the working classes: itis,
just this good will which the Kyrle Society has @eadily kept
in view as the chief object to be attained to. And I say itis a
difficult thing toattain to. Do any of you find it hard tothink
how if you had been born among the unluckier classes you
would have looked upon art? for first you might well have
had no faintest idea of what the word meant:

‘you must have had a courageous heart indeed if, living in a
London slum, you could have had any hope of ever sharing.
in it. Nay, tis a dreadful thing to have to say, a frightful
threat against the stability of Society, but there would most
like have been in you a feeling of spite and i
against what inborn spirit of refinement you
unless your good-nature overcame it would impel you to a
silent (perhaps silent) rage against the half-known good
that you had so little chance of sharing. Indeed I fear that
with many, nay most of us, that isall the fellowship with art
Be ere tad nd one had red to help us in ue
quagmire of sordidness. Most true it is that whiles when 1
4m sitting at home at work or in rest with all the aids toa
pleasant life around me which mere chance as it seems has
given me, and I hear outside brutal and drunken voices,
‘murdering with obscenelanguageand coarsetoncstheple
sure of the fair spring Sunday, there rises up in me the bru-
tality of my own heart and would stir me into fury against
that other brutality if I did not remember that these also are
my fellows, merely unluckier than I: not worse. And then
indeed I falla-wondering at the Strange and slender thread
of circumstance which has armed me fordoing and forbear-
ing with that refinement which I didn’t make myself, but
201

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 
was born into. That, I'say, I wonder at; but not at all atthe
scenes of savagery that disgrace our Streets at the worst, at
thebreaking of treesand uprooting of flowers, andscoring of
images nd the like which do hereand theretake place;done
Limagine by a very few hands if we came to look into i
at greater matters than that; all the crimes that people with-
out amusement but with their full share of love of excite-
‘ment must needs fall into from time to time.

‘And, Sir, ‘tis at these times of shame, when my own re-
sponsibility for all this weighs heaviest tipon me that I feel
most gratitude towards those pioneers of hope who have
shown us that there is something to be done to better it,
those who while they know mostof this shameful side of our
civilization fear least to face it, and, trusting to the mass of
innate good will that is abundantly to be found even among
the squalor of our great towns, have determined to do that
something, though to many it may appear but little and to
themselves least of all. I do not doubt that their ideal of
Society is high—nay the highest: T do not believe that they
look upon the pratical work they are doing as mere pli
tion of a tate of things which they are contented to look
upon as necessary and enduring. Doubtless they have been
able to say even in times of dejection, when the hope of radi-
cal change was furthest from them, We have at least made a
few people happier here and there, and that at all events is
something. This has been # mere consolation to incyttable
weakness: what they have been looking to s this rather, that
every one whom they have enlightened, everyone to whom
they have shown the existence of art and the possibility of
even poor people getting some enjoyment fromit, everybody
to whom they have given a better chance of seeing leaves
and flowers and grass from time to time has been turned
in a small way into a missionary of beauty; for their trust
te been e iso ug bak ee
cculture but an inborn part of every man born into the wor
which is only unproduétive when itis forcibly stifled. Nor
do I think that they will find their trust deceive thems I be-
Tieve those whom they have helped will not besilently grate-

ful only, but will be inclined to elbow their neighbours with |
a ‘Here see you; this pretty thing, and this; such things are |
to be got if we look out and help ourselves.”

Now if they have had any such success I must needs think
thatit hasbeen earnedon the wholeby wisdomand prudence
in a difficult and delicate task: for the Society has entered
perforce on the perilous path of gift perilous, I say,
for gift-giving 1s an art, and the penalty of breaking the
rules of that art is that the gift injures both giver and taker
and not seldom sets them by the ears. Carelessness, self-
seeking, patronage, these are the snares besetting the art,
from which I seriously think the Kyrle Society has escaped
scot-free: and the token of this is the thorough good will
with which their gifts have been taken; there has been gain
onone side in the matter, and no loss on the other.

Perhaps our own members will excuse a word of caution
from me on this matter of gift-giving: I need not tell them
that giving away what one does not value oneself is no gift.
‘That they will know very well; but furthermore it is so plea-
sant to do a piece of work and give it away, that is so very
mucha pleasure on a pleasure, that we are sometimes over-
enthusiastic about our own work under these blinding cir-
‘cumstances. In short, we ought to be very careful that any
work of decoration that we do should be at least up to the
andard of marketable work of a similar kind—and as
much beyond it as possible. We must not assume because
people unused to art like what we furnish them with itis
therefore good enough for them; nothing but good—that
is, real—art is of any good to anyone.

But a good deal of the work of the Kyrle Society is of a
kind that I should think almost everyone would admit to
‘be useful; though how specially useful it may bein Notting
ham Lasalmost a Stranger cannot tell. Tam alluding to the

ety's efforts to get more light and air nto our big towns,

‘our well-beloved but very criminal London more especial-

ly: itis cheering to find that on the whole public opinion is

‘with us on this point. ‘Thatis to say at least that the public

‘would very decidedly like our towns to be free from smoke,
203

    

  

   

 

 

 

 

 
and to have many open spaces in them, if they could get
these advantages without spending any trouble or money
on them. How that can be done I don’t profess to be able to
tell them, and should be against the appointment of a sub-
‘Committee of the Society to consider how ’tis possible to
carry out impossibilities: nevertheless it is a great Step to
have made that people will think about the matter at all,
that they have begun to be somewhat ashamed of the smoke
and squalor of our big towns. Time was when we were
rather proud of it: let us hope that the next step, and not a
far digtant one, will be that a very great number of people.
will be ready to make considerable sacrifices both of time
and money, for theattainment of a decentlife; and the next,
though that belike is a long way off, that only a snvall mi-
nority will refuse to make those sacrifices: such a very
small minority at last, that the nation will ask its represen-
tatives to make laws that will enable it to gain these advan-
tages without injustice to individuals, and to find it servants
who will ensure their being carried out.

Well of course 1 know we have got along way totravel
before we come to that, and by the time such laws are made
very few will be in the least inclined to break them. Long
before that time a capitalist will bas much ashamed flee
ting his factory chimnies pour out a dense cloud of smoke
as he would be now of robbing onthe highway; a rslway
company will no more think of running their line through a
recreation ground of the people than they now would
through Buckingham Palace; the Square gardens will be
both unfenced and unhurt: nay the quarters will
have somegardenorother, publicor private, easilyaccessible
tp them a6 landowner will grudge people wandering Ofer
his park or fields, where they are doing no damage to stocks
or crops; nor indeed will anybody think of going anywhere
where they could do damage; no builder will cut down a
tree until he has exhausted his ingenuity in planning his
houses so as to avoid it.

Sir, Iam as sure that that day will come, as that I shall
not see it with my bodily eyes: in that day the work of the
