<p>THE DECORATIVE ARTS.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">3</span>
Hereafter I hope in another lecture to have the pleasure
of laying before you an historical survey of the Decorative
Arts, and I must confess it would have been pleasanter
to me to have begun my talk with you by entering
at once upon the subject of the history of this great
industry; but, as I have something to say in a third
lecture about various matters connected with the practice
of Decoration among ourselves in these days, I feel that
I should be in a false position before you, and one that
might lead to confusion, or overmuch explanation, if I
did not let you know what I think on the nature and
scope of these arts, on their condition at the present time,
and their outlook in times to come. In doing this it
is like enough that I shall say things with which you
will very much disagree; I must ask you therefore from
the outset to believe that, whatever I may blame, or
whatever I may praise, I neither, when I think of what
history has been, am inclined to lament the past, to
despise the present, or despair of the future; that I
believe all the change and stir about us is a sign of the
world's life, and that it will lead—by ways, indeed, of
which we have no guess—to the bettering of all mankind.</p>

<p>Now as to the scope and nature of these Decorative
Arts I have to say, that though when I come more into
the details of my subject I shall not meddle much with
<span class="pagenum">4</span>
the great art of Architecture, and less still with the great
arts commonly called Sculpture and Painting, yet I
cannot in my own mind quite sever them from those
lesser, so-called Decorative Arts, which I have to speak
about: it is only in latter times, and under the most
intricate conditions of life, that they have fallen apart
from one another; and I hold that, when they are so
parted, it is ill for the Arts altogether: the lesser ones
become trivial, mechanical, unintelligent, incapable of
resisting the changes pressed upon them by fashion or
dishonesty; while the greater, however they may be
practised for a while by men of great minds and wonder-working
hands, unhelped by the lesser, unhelped by each
other, are sure to lose their dignity of popular arts, and
become nothing but dull adjuncts to unmeaning pomp,
or ingenious toys for a few rich and idle men.</p>

<p>However, I have not undertaken to talk to you of
Architecture, Sculpture, and Painting, in the narrower
sense of those words, since, most unhappily as I think,
these master-arts, these arts more specially of the intellect,
are at the present day divorced from decoration in its
narrower sense. Our subject is that great body of art, by
means of which men have at all times more or less striven
to beautify the familiar matters of everyday life: a wide
subject, a great industry; both a great part of the history
of the world, and a most helpful instrument to the study
of that history.</p>

<p>A very great industry indeed, comprising the trades
of house-building, painting, joinery and carpentry,
smiths' work, pottery and glass-making, weaving, and
many others: a body of art most important to the public
in general, but still more so to us handicraftsmen; since
<span class="pagenum">5</span>
there is scarce anything that they use, and that we fashion,
but it has always been thought to be unfinished till it
has had some touch or other of decoration about it. True
it is, that in many or most cases we have got so used to
this ornament, that we look upon it as if it had grown
of itself, and note it no more than the mosses on the
dry sticks with which we light our fires. So much the
worse! for there <em>is</em> the decoration, or some pretence of
it, and it has, or ought to have, a use and a meaning.
For, and this is at the root of the whole matter, everything
made by man's hands has a form, which must be
either beautiful or ugly; beautiful if it is in accord with
Nature, and helps her; ugly if it is discordant with Nature,
and thwarts her; it cannot be indifferent: we, for our parts,
are busy or sluggish, eager or unhappy, and our eyes are
apt to get dulled to this eventfulness of form in those
things which we are always looking at. Now it is one
of the chief uses of decoration, the chief part of its alliance
with nature, that it has to sharpen our dulled senses in
this matter: for this end are those wonders of intricate
patterns interwoven, those strange forms invented, that
men have so long delighted in: forms and intricacies that
do not necessarily imitate nature, but in which the hand
of the craftsman is guided to work in the way that she
does, till the web, the cup, or the knife, look as natural,
nay as lovely, as the green field, the river bank, or the
mountain flint.</p>

<p>To give people pleasure in the things they must perforce
<em>use,</em> that is one great office of decoration; to give
people pleasure in the things they must perforce <em>make,</em>
that is the other use of it.</p>

<p>Does not our subject look important enough now?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">6</span>
I say that without these arts, our rest would be vacant
and uninteresting, our labour mere endurance, mere
wearing away of body and mind.</p>

<p>As for that last use of these arts, the giving us
pleasure in our work, I scarcely know how to speak
strongly enough of it; and yet if I did not know the
value of repeating a truth again and again, I should
have to excuse myself to you for saying any more about
this, when I remember how a great man now living has
spoken of it: I mean my friend Professor John Ruskin:
if you read the chapter in the 2nd vol. of his <em>Stones
of Venice</em> entitled, 'On the Nature of Gothic, and the
Office of the Workman therein,' you will read at once
the truest and the most eloquent words that can possibly
be said on the subject. What I have to say upon it
can scarcely be more than an echo of his words, yet I
repeat there is some use in reiterating a truth, lest it
be forgotten; so I will say this much further: we all
know what people have said about the curse of labour,
and what heavy and grievous nonsense are the more part
of their words thereupon; whereas indeed the real curses
of craftsmen have been the curse of stupidity, and the
curse of injustice from within and from without: no,
I cannot suppose there is anybody here who would think
it either a good life, or an amusing one, to sit with one's
hands before one doing nothing — to live like a gentleman,
as fools call it.</p>

<p>Nevertheless there <em>is</em> dull work to be done, and a
weary business it is setting men about such work, and
seeing them through it, and I would rather do the work
twice over with my own hands than have such a job:
but now only let the arts we are talking of ornament our
<span class="pagenum">7</span>
labour, and be widely spread, intelligent, well understood
both by the maker and the user, let them grow in one
word <em>popular,</em> and there will be pretty much an end of dull
work and its wearing slavery; and no man will any longer
have an excuse for talking about the curse of labour, no
man will any longer have an excuse for evading the blessing
of labour. I believe there is nothing that will aid the
world's progress so much as the attainment of this; I protest
there is nothing in the world that I desire so much as
this, wrapped up, as I am sure it is, with changes political
and social, that in one way or another we all desire.</p>

<p>Now if the objection be made, that these arts have been
the handmaids of luxury, of tyranny, and of superstition, I
must needs say that it is true in a sense; they have been so
used, as many other excellent things have been. It is also
true that, among some nations, their most vigorous and
freest times have been the very blossoming times of art:
while at the same time, I must allow that these decorative
arts have flourished among oppressed peoples, who have
seemed to have no hope of freedom: yet I do not think that
we shall be wrong in thinking that at such times, among
such peoples, art at least was free; when it has not been,
when it has really been gripped by superstition, by luxury,
it has straightway begun to sicken under that grip. Nor
must you forget that when men say popes, kings, and
emperors built such and such buildings, it is a mere way
of speaking. You look in your history-books to see who
built Westminster Abbey, who built St. Sophia at Constantinople,
and they tell you Henry III., Justinian the
Emperor. Did they? or, rather, men like you and me,
handicraftsmen, who have left no names behind them,
nothing but their work?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">8</span>
Now as these arts call people's attention and interest
to the matters of every-day life in the present, so also,
and that I think is no little matter, they call our attention
at every step to that history, of which, I said before, they
are so great a part; for no nation, no state of society,
however rude, has been wholly without them: nay, there
are peoples not a few, of whom we know scarce anything,
save that they thought such and such forms beautiful.
So strong is the bond between history and decoration, that
in the practice of the latter we cannot, if we would, wholly
shake off the influence of past times over what we do at
present. I do not think it is too much to say that no
man, however original he may be, can sit down to-day
and draw the ornament of a cloth, or the form of an
ordinary vessel or piece of furniture, that will be other
than a development or a degradation of forms used
hundreds of years ago; and these, too, very often, forms
that once had a serious meaning, though they are now
become little more than a habit of the hand; forms that
were once perhaps the mysterious symbols of worships
and beliefs now little remembered or wholly forgotten.
Those who have diligently followed the delightful study of
these arts are able as if through windows to look upon the
life of the past:—the very first beginnings of thought
among nations whom we cannot even name; the terrible
empires of the ancient East; the free vigour and glory of
Greece; the heavy weight, the firm grasp of Rome; the
fall of her temporal Empire which spread so wide about the
world all that good and evil that men can never forget,
and never cease to feel; the clashing of East and West,
South and North, about her rich and fruitful daughter
Byzantium; the rise, the dissension, and the waning of
<span class="pagenum">9</span>
Islam; the wanderings of Scandinavia, the Crusades, the
foundation of the States of modern Europe, the struggles
of free thought with ancient dying system—with all these
events and their meaning is the history of popular art
interwoven; with all this, I say, the careful student of
decoration as an historical industry must be familiar.
When I think of this, and the usefulness of all this knowledge,
at a time when history has become so earnest a
study amongst us as to have given us, as it were, a new
sense; at a time when we so long to know the reality of
all that has happened, and are to be put off no longer with
the dull records of the battles and intrigues of kings and
scoundrels, — I say when I think of all this, I hardly know
how to say that this connexion of the Decorative Arts
with the history of the past is of less importance than
their dealings with the life of the present: for should
not these memories also be a part of our daily life?</p>

<p>And now let me recapitulate a little before I go
further, before we begin to look into the condition of the
arts at the present day. These arts, I have said, are
part of a great system invented for the expression of a
man's delight in beauty: all peoples and times have used
them; they have been the joy of free nations, and the
solace of oppressed nations; religion has used and elevated
them, has abused and degraded them; they are connected
with all history, and are clear teachers of it; and, best of
all, they are the sweeteners of human labour, both to the
handicraftsman, whose life is spent in working in them,
and to people in general who are influenced by the sight
of them at every turn of the day's work: they make our
toil happy, our rest fruitful.</p>

<p>And now if all I have said seems to you but mere
<span class="pagenum">10</span>
open-mouthed praise of these arts, I must say that it is
not for nothing that what I have hitherto put before you
has taken that form.</p>

<p>It is because I must now ask you this question: All
these good things—will you have them? will you cast
them from you?</p>

<p>Are you surprised at my question—you, most of whom,
like myself, are engaged in the actual practice of the arts
that are, or ought to be, popular?</p>

<p>In explanation, I must somewhat repeat what I have
already said. Time was when the mystery and wonder
of handicrafts were well acknowledged by the world, when
imagination and fancy mingled with all things made
by man; and in those days all handicraftsmen were artists,
as we should now call them. But the thought of man
became more intricate, more difficult to express; art grew
a heavier thing to deal with, and its labour was more
divided among great men, lesser men, and little men; till
that art, which was once scarce more than a rest of body
and soul, as the hand cast the shuttle or swung the
hammer, became to some men so serious a labour, that
their lives have been one long tragedy of hope and fear,
joy and trouble. This was the growth of art: like all
growth, it was good and fruitful for awhile; like all
fruitful growth, it grew into decay; like all decay of what
was once fruitful, it will grow into something new.</p>

<p>Into decay; for as the arts sundered into the greater
and the lesser, contempt on one side, carelessness on the
other arose, both begotten of ignorance of that philosophy
of the Decorative Arts, a very slight outline of which I
have tried just now to put before you. The artist came
out from the handicraftsmen, and left them without hope
<span class="pagenum">11</span>
of elevation, while he himself was left without the help
of intelligent, industrious sympathy. Both have suffered;
the artist no less than the workman. It is with art as it
fares with a company of soldiers before a redoubt, when
the captain runs forward full of hope and energy, but
looks not behind him to see if his men are following, and
they hang back, not knowing why they are brought there
to die. The captain's life is spent for nothing, and his
men are sullen prisoners in the redoubt of Unhappiness
and Brutality.</p>

<p>I must in plain words say of the Decorative Arts, of
all the arts, that it is not merely that we are inferior in
them to all who have gone before us, but also that they
are in a state of anarchy and disorganization, that makes
a sweeping change necessary and certain.</p>

<p>So that again I ask my question. All that good fruit
which the arts should bear, will you have it? will you cast
it from you? Shall that sweeping change that must
come be the change of loss or of gain? We who believe
in the continuous life of the world, surely we are bound
to hope that the change will bring us gain and not loss,
and to strive to bring that gain about.</p>

<p>How the world may answer my question, who can
say? A man in his short life can see but a little way
ahead, and even in mine wonderful and unexpected things
have come to pass. I must needs say that therein lies my
hope rather than in all I see going on round about us.
Without disputing that if the imaginative arts perish, some
new thing, at present unguessed of, <em>may</em> be put forward to
supply their loss in men's lives, I cannot feel happy in that
prospect, nor can I believe that mankind will endure such
a loss for ever: but in the meantime the present state of
the arts and their dealings with modern life and progress
<span class="pagenum">12</span>
seem to me to point in appearance to this immediate
future; that the world, which has for a long time busied
itself about other matters than the arts, and has carelessly
let them sink lower and lower, till many not uncultivated
men, ignorant of what they once were, and hopeless of
what they might yet be, look upon them with mere contempt;
that the world, I say, thus busied and hurried, will
one day wipe the slate, and be clean rid in her impatience
of the whole matter with all its tangle, and then—what
then? Even now amid the squalor of London it is hard
to imagine what it will be. Architecture, Sculpture,
Painting, with the crowd of lesser arts that belong to them,
these, together with Music and Poetry, will be dead and
forgotten, will no longer excite or amuse people in the
least: for, once more, we must not deceive ourselves; the
death of one art means the death of all; the only difference
in their fate will be that the luckiest will be eaten the
last—the luckiest, or the unluckiest: in all that has to do
with beauty the invention and ingenuity of man will have
come to a dead stop; and all the while Nature will go on
with her eternal recurrence of lovely changes: spring,
summer, autumn, and winter; sunshine, rain, and snow,
storm and fair weather; dawn, noon, and sunset, day and
night — ever bearing witness against man that he has
deliberately chosen ugliness instead of beauty, and to live
where he is strongest amidst squalor or blank emptiness.</p>

<p>You see, sirs, we cannot quite imagine it; any more,
perhaps, than our forefathers of ancient London, living in
the pretty, carefully whitened houses, with the famous
church and its huge spire rising above them, — than they,
passing about the fair gardens running down to the broad
<span class="pagenum">13</span>
river, could have imagined a whole county or more
covered over with hideous hovels, big, middle-sized, and
little, which should one day be called London.</p>

<p>Sirs, I say this dead blank of the arts that I more than
dread is difficult even now to imagine; yet I fear that I
must say that if it does not come about, it will be owing
to some turn of events which we cannot at present foresee:
but I hold that if it does happen, it will only last for a
time, that it will be but a burning up of the gathered
weeds, so that the field may bear more abundantly. I
hold that men would wake up after a while, and look
round and find the dulness unbearable, and begin once
more inventing, imitating, and imagining, as in earlier
days.</p>

<p>That faith comforts me, and I can say calmly if the
blank space must happen, it must, and amidst its darkness
the new seed must sprout. So it has been before:
birth, and hope scarcely conscious of itself; then the flower
and fruit of mastery, with hope more than conscious enough,
passing into insolence as decay follows ripeness; and
then—the new birth again.</p>

<p>Meantime it is the plain duty of all who look seriously
on the arts to do their best to save the world from what
at the best will be a loss, the result of ignorance and
unwisdom; to prevent, in fact, that most discouraging of
all changes, the supplying the place of an extinct brutality
by a new one; nay, even if those who really care for the
arts are so weak and few that they can do nothing else, it
may be their business to keep alive some tradition, some
memory of the past, so that the new life when it comes
may not waste itself more than enough in fashioning
wholly new forms for its new spirit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">14</span>
To what side then shall those turn for help, who really
understand the gain of a great art in the world, and the
loss of peace and good life that must follow from the lack
of it? I think that they must begin by acknowledging
that the ancient art, the art of unconscious intelligence, as
one should call it, which began without a date, at least so
long ago as those strange and masterly scratchings on
mammoth-bones and the like found but the other day in
the drift—that this art of unconscious intelligence is all
but dead; that what little of it is left lingers among
half-civilised nations, and is growing coarser, feebler, less
intelligent year by year; nay, is mostly at the mercy of
some commercial accident, such as the arrival of a few
shiploads of European dye-stuffs or a few dozen orders
from European merchants: this they must recognise, and
must hope to see in time its place filled by a new art of
conscious intelligence, the birth of wiser, simpler, freer
ways of life than the world leads now, than the world has
ever led.</p>

<p>I said, <em>to see</em> this in time; I do not mean to say that
our own eyes will look upon it: it may be so far off, as
indeed it seems to some, that many would scarcely think
it worth while thinking of: but there are some of us who
cannot turn our faces to the wall, or sit deedless because
our hope seems somewhat dim; and, indeed, I think that
while the signs of the last decay of the old art with all the
evils that must follow in its train are only too obvious
about us, so on the other hand there are not wanting signs
of the new dawn beyond that possible night of the arts, of
which I have before spoken: this sign chiefly, that there
are some few at least who are heartily discontented with
things as they are, and crave for something better, or at
<span class="pagenum">15</span>
least some promise of it — this best of signs: for I suppose
that if some half-dozen men at any time earnestly set their
hearts on something coming about which is not discordant
with nature, it will come to pass one day or other; because
it is not by accident that an idea comes into the heads of a
few; rather they are pushed on, and forced to speak or act
by something stirring in the heart of the world which
would otherwise be left without expression.</p>

<p>By what means then shall those work who long for
reform in the arts, and whom shall they seek to kindle
into eager desire for possession of beauty, and better still,
for the development of the faculty that creates beauty?</p>

<p>People say to me often enough: If you want to make
your art succeed and flourish, you must make it the
fashion: a phrase which I confess annoys me: for they
mean by it that I should spend one day over my work to
two days in trying to convince rich, and supposed influential
people, that they cared very much for what they do
not care in the least, so that it may happen according to
the proverb: <em>Bell-wether took the leap and we all went
over:</em> well, such advisers are right if they are content
with the thing lasting but a little while; say till you can
make a little money — if you don't get pinched by the
door shutting too quickly: otherwise they are wrong: the
people they are thinking of have too many strings to
their bow and can turn their backs too easily on a thing
that fails, for it to be safe work trusting to their whims:
it is not their fault, they cannot help it, but they have no
chance of spending time enough over the arts to know
anything practical of them, and they must of necessity be
in the hands of those who spend their time in pushing
fashion this way and that for their own advantage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">16</span>
Sirs, there is no help to be got out of these latter,
or those who let themselves be led by them: the only
real help for the decorative arts must come from those
who work in them; nor must they be led, they must lead.</p>

<p>You whose hands make those things that should be
works of art, you must be all artists and good artists before
the public at large can take real interest in such things;
and when you have become so, I promise you that you
shall lead the fashion; fashion shall follow your hands
obediently enough.</p>

<p>That is the only way in which we can get a supply
of intelligent popular art: a few artists of the kind
so-called now, what can they do working in the teeth
of difficulties thrown in their way by what is called
Commerce, but which should be called greed of money,
working helplessly among the crowd of those who are
ridiculously called manufacturers, <em>i.e.</em> handicraftsmen,
though the more part of them never did a stroke of
hand-work in their lives, and are nothing better than
capitalists and salesmen.—What can these grains of sand
do, I say, amidst the enormous mass of work turned out
every year which professes in some way to be decorative
art, but the decoration of which no one heeds except the
salesmen who have to do with it, and are hard put to it to
supply the cravings of the public for something new, not
for something pretty?</p>

<p>The remedy I repeat is plain if it can be applied; the
handicraftsman, left behind by the artist when the arts
sundered, must come up with him, must work side by side
with him: apart from the difference between a great master
and a scholar, apart from the differences of the natural bent
of men's minds, which would make one man an imitative,
<span class="pagenum">17</span>
and another an architectural or decorative artist, there
should be no difference between those employed on
strictly ornamental work; and the body of artists dealing
with this should quicken with their art all makers of
things into artists also, in proportion to the necessities
and uses of the things they would make.</p>

<p>I know what stupendous difficulties social and economical
there are in the way of this; yet I think that
they seem to be greater than they are: and of one thing
I am sure, that no real living decorative art is possible if
this is impossible.</p>

<p>It is not impossible, on the contrary it is certain to
come about, if you are at heart desirous to quicken the arts;
if the world will, for the sake of beauty and decency, sacrifice
some of the things it is so busy over (many of which
I think are not very worthy of its trouble) art will begin
to grow again; as for those difficulties above mentioned,
some of them I know will in any case melt away before
the steady change of the relative conditions of men; the
rest, reason and resolute attention to the laws of nature,
which are also the laws of art, will dispose of little by
little: once more the way will not be far to seek, if the
will be with us.</p>

<p>Yet, granted the will, and though the way lies ready
to us, we must not be discouraged if the journey seem
barren enough at first, nay, not even if things seem to
grow worse for a while: for it is natural enough that the
very evil which has forced on the beginning of reform
should look uglier while, on the one hand, life and wisdom
are building up the new, and on the other, folly and
deadness are hugging the old to them.</p>

<p>In this, as in all other matters, lapse of time will be
<span class="pagenum">18</span>
needed before things seem to straighten, and the courage
and patience that does not despise small things lying ready
to be done; and care and watchfulness, lest we begin to
build the wall ere the footings are well in, and always
through all things much humility that is not easily cast down
by failure, that seeks to be taught, and is ready to learn.</p>

<p>For your teachers, they must be Nature and History:
as for the first that you must learn of it is so obvious that
I need not dwell upon that now: hereafter, when I have
to speak more of matters of detail, I may have to speak of
the manner in which you must learn of Nature. As to the
second, I do not think that any man but one of the highest
genius could do anything in these days without much study
of ancient art, and even he would be much hindered if he
lacked it. If you think that this contradicts what I said
about the death of that ancient art, and the necessity I implied
for an art that should be characteristic of the present
day, I can only say that, in these times of plenteous knowledge
and meagre performance, if we do not study the
ancient work directly and learn to understand it, we shall
find ourselves influenced by the feeble work all round us,
and shall be copying the better work through the copyists
and <em>without</em> understanding it, which will by no means
bring about intelligent art. Let us therefore study it
wisely, be taught by it, kindled by it; all the while determining
not to imitate or repeat it, to have either no art at
all, or an art which we have made our own.</p>

<p>Yet I am almost brought to a stand-still when bidding
you to study nature and the history of art, by remembering
that this is London, and what it is like: how can I ask
working-men passing up and down these hideous streets
day by day to care about beauty? If it were politics, we
<span class="pagenum">19</span>
must care about that; or science, you could wrap yourselves
up in the study of facts, no doubt, without much
caring what goes on about you—but beauty! do you not
see what terrible difficulties beset art, owing to a long
neglect of art—and neglect of reason, too, in this matter?
It is such a heavy question by what effort, by what deadlift,
you can thrust this difficulty from you, that I must
perforce set it aside for the present, and must at least
hope that the study of history and its monuments will
help you somewhat herein. If you can really fill your
minds with memories of great works of art, and great
times of art, you will, I think, be able to a certain extent
to look through the aforesaid ugly surroundings, and will
be moved to discontent of what is careless and brutal
now, and will, I hope, at last be so much discontented
with what is bad, that you will determine to bear no
longer that short-sighted, reckless brutality of squalor
that so disgraces our intricate civilization.</p>

<p>Well, at any rate, London is good for this, that it is well
off for museums, — which I heartily wish were to be got at
seven days in the week instead of six; and certainly any
of us who may have any natural turn for art must get more
help from frequenting them than one can well say. It is true,
however, that people need some preliminary instruction
before they can get all the good possible to be got from
the prodigious treasures of art possessed by the country in
that form: there also one sees things in a piece-meal way:
nor can I deny that there is something melancholy about
a museum, such a tale of violence, destruction, and
carelessness, as its treasured scraps tell us.</p>

<p>But moreover you may sometimes have an opportunity
of studying ancient art in a narrower but a more intimate,
<span class="pagenum">20</span>
a more kindly form, the monuments of our land: Sometimes
only, since we live in the middle of this world of
brick and mortar, and there is little else left us amidst it,
except the ghost of the glorious church at Westminster
and the Hall beside it: but when we can get beyond
that smoky world, there out in the country we may
see the works of our fathers yet alive amidst the very
nature they were wrought into, and of which they are so
completely a part: for there indeed if anywhere, in the
English country, in the days when people cared about
such things, was there a full sympathy between the works
of man, and the land they were made for:—the land is a
little land. Sirs, too much shut up within the narrow seas,
as it seems, to have much space for swelling into hugeness:
there are no great wastes overwhelming in their
dreariness, no great solitudes of forests, no terrible untrodden
mountain-walls: all is measured, mingled, varied,
gliding easily one thing into another: little rivers, little
plains, swelling, speedily-changing uplands, all beset with
handsome orderly trees; little hills, little mountains, netted
over with the walls of sheep-walks: all is little; yet not
foolish and blank, but serious rather, and abundant of
meaning for such as choose to seek it: it is neither prison,
nor palace, but a decent home.</p>

<p>All which I neither praise nor blame, but say that so it
is: some people praise this homeliness overmuch, as if the
land were the very axle-tree of the world; so do not I, nor
any unblinded by pride in themselves and all that belongs
to them: others there are who scorn it and the tameness of
it: not I any the more: though it would indeed be hard
if there were nothing else in the world, no wonders, no
terrors, no unspeakable beauties: yet when we think what
<span class="pagenum">21</span>
a small part of the world's history, past, present, and to
come, is this land we live in, and how much smaller still in
the history of the arts, and yet how our forefathers clung
to it, and with what care and pains they adorned it, this
unromantic, uneventful-looking land of England, surely by
this too our hearts may be touched and our hope quickened.</p>

<p>For as was the land, such was the art of it while folk
yet troubled themselves about such things; it strove little
to impress people either by pomp or ingenuity: not unseldom
it fell into commonplace, rarely it rose into
majesty; yet was it never oppressive, never a slave's
nightmare or an insolent boast: and at its best it had an
inventiveness, an individuality, that grander styles have
never overpassed: its best too, and that was in its very
heart, was given as freely to the yeoman's house, and the
humble village church, as to the lord's palace or the
mighty cathedral: never coarse, though often rude enough,
sweet, natural and unaffected, an art of peasants rather
than of merchant-princes or courtiers, it must be a hard
heart, I think, that does not love it: whether a man has
been born among it like ourselves, or has come wonderingly
on its simplicity from all the grandeur over-seas.
A peasant art, I say, and it clung fast to the life of the
people, and still lived among the cottagers and yeomen
in many parts of the country while the big houses were
being built 'French and fine': Still lived also in many
a quaint pattern of loom and printing-block, and embroiderer's
needle, while over-seas stupid pomp had
extinguished all nature and freedom, and art was become,
in France especially, the mere expression of that successful
and exultant rascality which in the flesh no long
time afterwards went down into the pit for ever.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">22</span>
Such was the English art, whose history is in a sense
at your doors, grown scarce indeed, and growing scarcer
year by year, not only through greedy destruction, of
which there is certainty less than there used to be, but
also through the attacks of another foe, called now-a-days
'restoration.'</p>

<p>I must not make a long story about this, but also I
cannot quite pass it over, since I have pressed on you the
study of these ancient monuments. Thus the matter
stands: these old buildings have been altered and added
to century after century, often beautifully, always historically;
their very value, a great part of it, lay in that:
they have suffered too almost always from neglect,
often from violence (that latter also a piece of history
often far from uninteresting), but ordinary obvious mending
would almost always have kept them standing, pieces
of nature and of history.</p>

<p>But of late years a great uprising of ecclesiastical zeal,
€coinciding with a great increase of study, and consequently
of knowledge of mediaeval architecture, has driven people
into spending their money on these buildings, not merely
with the purpose of repairing them, of keeping them safe,
clean, and wind and water-tight, but also of 'restoring'
them to some ideal state of perfection; sweeping away if
possible all signs of what has befallen them at least since
the Reformation, and often since dates much earlier: this
has sometimes been done with much disregard of art and
entirely from ecclesiastical zeal, but oftener it has been
well meant enough as regards art: yet you will not have
listened to what I have said to-night if you do not see
that from my point of view this restoration must be as
impossible to bring about as the attempt at it is destructive
<span class="pagenum">23</span>
to the buildings so dealt with: I scarcely like to think
what a great part of them have been made nearly useless
to students of art and history: unless you knew a great
deal about architecture you perhaps would scarce understand
what terrible damage has been done by that dangerous
'little knowledge' in this matter, but this I think is
easy to be understood, that to deal recklessly with valuable
(and national) monuments which, when once gone, can
never be replaced by any splendour of modern art, is
doing a very sorry service to the State.</p>

<p>You will see by all that I have said on this study of
ancient art that I mean by education herein something
much wider than the teaching of a definite art in schools
of design, and that it must be something that we must
do more or less for ourselves: I mean by it a systematic
concentration of our thoughts on the matter, a studying
of it in all ways, careful and laborious practice of it, and
a determination to do nothing but what is known to be
good in workmanship and design.</p>

<p>Of course, however, both as an instrument of that study
we have been speaking of, as well as of the practice of the
arts, all handicraftsmen should be taught to draw very
carefully; as indeed all people should be taught drawing
who are not physically incapable of learning it: but the
art of drawing so taught would not be the art of designing,
but only a means toward <em>this</em> end, <em>general capability in
dealing with the arts.</em></p>

<p>For I wish specially to impress this upon you, that
<em>designing</em> cannot be taught at all in a school: continued
practice will help a man who is naturally a designer, continual
notice of nature and of art: no doubt those who
have some faculty for designing are still numerous, and
<span class="pagenum">24</span>
they want from a school certain technical teaching, just
as they want tools: in these days also, when the best school,
the school of successful practice going on around you, is at
such a low ebb, they do undoubtedly want instruction in
the history of the arts: these two things schools of design
can give: but the royal road of a set of rules deduced from
a sham science of design, that is itself not a science but
another set of rules, will lead nowhere;—or, let us rather
say, to beginning again.</p>

<p>As to the kind of drawing that should be taught to men
engaged in ornamental work, there is only <em>one</em> best way of
teaching drawing, and that is teaching the scholar to draw
the human figure: both because the lines of a man's body
are much more subtle than anything else, and because you
can more surely be found out and set right if you go wrong.
I do think that such teaching as this, given to all people
who care for it, would help the revival of the arts very
much: the habit of discriminating between right and
wrong, the sense of pleasure in drawing a good line, would
really, I think, be education in the due sense of the word
for all such people as had the germs of invention in them;
yet as aforesaid, in this age of the world it would be mere
affectation to pretend to shut one's eyes to the art of past
ages: that also we must study. If other circumstances,
social and economical do not stand in our way, that is
to say, if the world is not too busy to allow us to have
Decorative Arts at all, these two are the <em>direct</em> means by
which we shall get them; that is, general cultivation of
the powers of the mind, general cultivation of the powers
of the eye and hand.</p>

<p>Perhaps that seems to you very commonplace advice
and a very roundabout road; nevertheless 'tis a certain
<span class="pagenum">25</span>
one, if by any road you desire to come to the new art,
which is my subject to-night: if you do not, and if those
germs of invention, which, as I said just now, are no doubt
still common enough among men, are left neglected and
undeveloped, the laws of Nature will assert themselves in
this as in other matters, and the faculty of design itself
will gradually fade from the race of man. Sirs, shall we
approach nearer to perfection by casting away so large a
part of that intelligence that makes us <em>men?</em></p>

<p>And now before I make an end, I want to call your
.attention to certain things, that, owing to our neglect of
the arts for other business, bar that good road to us and
are such a hindrance, that, till they are dealt with, it is
hard even to make a beginning of our endeavour. And if
my talk should seem to grow too serious for our subject, as
indeed I think it cannot do, I beg you to remember what
I said earlier, of how the arts all hang together. Now
there is one art of which the old architect of Edward the
Third's time was thinking — he who founded New College,
Oxford, I mean — when he took this for his motto: ' Manners
maketh man:' he meant by manners the art of morals, the
art of living worthily, and like a man. I must needs claim
this art also as dealing with my subject.</p>

<p>Sirs, there is a great deal of sham work in the world,
hurtful to the buyer, more hurtful to the seller, if he only
knew it, most hurtful to the maker: how good a foundation
it would be toward getting good Decorative Art, that is
ornamental workmanship, if we craftsmen were to resolve
to turn out nothing but excellent workmanship in all things,
instead of having, as we too often have now, a very low
average standard of work, which we often fall below.</p>

<p>I do not blame either one class or another in this matter,
<span class="pagenum">26</span>
I blame all: to set aside our own class of handicraftsmen,
of whose shortcomings you and I know so much that
we need talk no more about it, I know that the public in
general are set on having things cheap, being so ignorant
that they do not know when they get them nasty also, so
ignorant that they neither know nor care whether they
give a man his due: I know that the manufacturers (socalled)
are so set on carrying out competition to its utmost,
competition of cheapness, not of excellence, that they meet
the bargain-hunters half way, and cheerfully furnish them
with nasty wares at the cheap rate they are asked for, by
means of what can be called by no prettier name than
fraud. England has of late been too much busied with the
counting-house and not enough with the workshop: with
the result that the counting-house at the present moment
is rather barren of orders.</p>

<p>I say all classes are to blame in this matter, but also I
say that the remedy lies with the handicraftsmen, who are
not ignorant of these things like the public, and who have
no call to be greedy and isolated like the manufacturers or
middlemen; the duty and honour of educating the public
lies with them, and they have in them the seeds of order
and organization which make that duty the easier.</p>

<p>When will they see to this and help to make men of
us all by insisting on this most weighty piece of manners;
so that we may adorn life with the pleasure of cheerfully
<em>buying</em> goods at their due price; with the pleasure of <em>selling</em>
goods that we could be proud of both for fair price and
fair workmanship: with the pleasure of working soundly
and without haste at <em>making</em> goods that we could be proud
of? — much the greatest pleasure of the three is that last,
such a pleasure as, I think, the world has none like it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">27</span>
You must not say that this piece of manners lies out
of my subject: it is essentially a part of it and most
important: for I am bidding you learn to be artists, if art
is not to come to an end amongst us: and what is an
artist but a workman who is determined that, whatever
else happens, his work shall be excellent? or, to put it in
another way: the decoration of workmanship, what is it
but the expression of man's pleasure in successful labour?
But what pleasure can there be in <em>bad</em> work, in <em>un</em>successful
labour, why should we decorate <em>that?</em> and how can we
bear to be always unsuccessful in our labour?</p>

<p>As greed of unfair gain, wanting to be paid for what
we have not earned, cumbers our path with this tangle of
bad work, of sham work, so the heaped-up money which
this greed has brought us (for greed will have its way,
sirs, like all other strong passions), this money, I say,
gathered into heaps little and big, with all the false distinction
which so unhappily it yet commands amongst us,
has raised up against the arts a barrier of the love of luxury
and show, which is of all obvious hindrances the worst to
overpass: the highest and most cultivated classes are not
free from the vulgarity of it, the lower are not free from
its pretence. I beg you to remember both as a remedy
against this, and as explaining exactly what I mean, that
nothing can be a work of art which is not useful; that is
to say, which does not minister to the body when well
under command of the mind, or which does not amuse,
soothe, or elevate the mind in a healthy state. What tons
upon tons of unutterable rubbish pretending to be works
of art in some degree would this maxim clear out of our
London houses, if it were understood and acted upon! To
my mind it is only here and there (out of the kitchen)
<span class="pagenum">28</span>
that you can find in a well-to-do house things that are of
any use at all: as a rule all the decoration (so called) that
has got there is there for the sake of show, not because
anybody likes it. I repeat, this stupidity goes through all
classes of society: the silk curtains in my Lord's drawingroom
are no more a matter of art to him than the powder
in his footman's hair; the kitchen in a country farmhouse
is most commonly a pleasant and homelike place, the
parlour dreary and useless.</p>

<p>Simplicity of life, begetting simplicity of taste, that is,
a love for sweet and lofty things, is of all matters most
necessary for the birth of the new and better art we
crave for; simplicity everywhere, in the palace as well as
in the cottage.</p>

<p>Still more is this necessary, cleanliness and decency
everywhere, in the cottage as well as in the palace: the
lack of that is a serious piece of <em>manners</em> for us to correct:
that lack and all the inequalities of life, and the heaped-up
thoughtlessness and disorder of so many centuries that
cause it: and as yet it is only a very few men who have
begun to think about a remedy for it in its widest range:
even in its narrower aspect, in the defacement of our big
towns by all that commerce brings with it, who heeds it?
who tries to control their squalor and hideousness? there
is nothing but thoughtlessness and recklessness in the
matter: the helplessness of people who don't live long
enough to do a thing themselves, and have not manliness
and foresight enough to begin the work, and pass it on to
those that shall come after them.</p>

<p>Is money to be gathered? cut down the pleasant trees
among the houses, pull down ancient and venerable
buildings for the money that a few square yards of
<span class="pagenum">29</span>
London dirt will fetch, blacken rivers, hide the sun and
poison the air with smoke and worse, and it's nobody's
business to see to it or mend it: that is all that modern
commerce, the counting-house forgetful of the workshop,
will do for us herein.</p>

<p>And Science—we have loved her well, and followed her
diligently, what will she do? I fear she is so much in
the pay of the counting-house, the counting-house and
the drill-sergeant, that she is too busy, and will for the
present do nothing. Yet there are matters which I
should have thought easy for her, say for example
teaching Manchester how to consume its own smoke, or
Leeds how to get rid of its superfluous black dye without
turning it into the river, which would be as much
worth her attention as the production of the heaviest
of heavy black silks, or the biggest of useless guns.
Anyhow, however it be done, unless people care about
carrying on their business without making the world
hideous, how can they care about art? I know it will
cost much both of time and money to better these things
even a little; but I do not see how these can be better
spent than in making life cheerful and honourable for
others and for ourselves; and the gain of good life
to the country at large that would result from men
seriously setting about the bettering of the decency
of our big towns would be priceless, even if nothing
specially good befell the arts in consequence: I do not
know that it would; but I should begin to think matters
hopeful if men turned their attention to such things, and
I repeat, that unless they do so, we can scarcely even
begin with any hope our endeavours for the bettering of
the Arts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">30</span>
Until something or other is done to give all men some
pleasure for the eyes and rest for the mind in the aspect
of their own and their neighbours' houses, until the contrast
is less disgraceful between the fields where beasts
live and the streets where men live, I suppose that the
practice of the arts must be mainly kept in the hands of a
few highly cultivated men, who can go often to beautiful
places, whose education enables them, in the contemplation
of the past glories of the world, to shut out from their
view the everyday squalors that the most of men move in.
Sirs, I believe that art has such sympathy with cheerful
freedom, open-heartedness, and reality, so much she
sickens under selfishness and luxury, that she will not live
thus isolated and exclusive. I will go further than this;,
and say that on such terms I do not wish her to live. I protest
that it would be a shame to an honest artist to enjoy
what he had huddled up to himself of such art, as it would
be for a rich man to sit and eat dainty food amongst
starving soldiers in a beleaguered fort.</p>

<p>I do not want art for a few, any more than education
for a few, or freedom for a few.</p>

<p>No, rather than art should live this poor thin life
among a few exceptional men, despising those beneath
them for an ignorance for which they themselves are
responsible, for a brutality that they will not struggle
with, — rather than this, I would that the world should
indeed sweep away all art for a while, as I said before I
thought it possible she might do: rather than the wheat
should rot in the miser's granary, I would that the earth
had it, that it might yet have a chance to quicken in the
dark.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">31</span>
I have a sort of faith, though, that this clearing away
of all art will not happen, that men will get wiser, as
well as more learned; that many of the intricacies of life,
on which we now pride ourselves more than enough,
partly because they are new, partly because they have
come with the gain of better things, will be cast aside as
having played their part, and being useful no longer. I
hope that we shall have leisure from war, — war commercial,
as well as war of the bullet and the bayonet; leisure from
the knowledge that darkens counsel; leisure above all from
the greed of money, and the craving for that overwhelming
distinction that money now brings: I believe that, as we
have even now partly achieved LIBERTY, so we shall achieve
EQUALITY, and best of all, FRATERNITY, and so have leisure
from poverty and all its griping, sordid cares.</p>

<p>Then, having leisure from all these things, amidst
renewed simplicity of life we shall have leisure to think
about our work, that faithful daily companion, which no
man any longer will venture to call the Curse of labour:
for surely then we shall be happy in it, each in his place,
no man grudging at another; no one bidden to be any
man's <em>servant,</em> everyone scorning to be any man's <em>master:</em>
men will then assuredly be happy in their work, and that
happiness will assuredly bring forth decorative, noble,
<em>popular</em> art.</p>

<p>That art will make our streets as beautiful as the
woods, as elevating as the mountain-sides: it will be a
pleasure and a rest, and not a weight upon the spirits
to come from the open country into a town; every man's
house will be fair and decent, soothing to his mind and
helpful to his work: all the works of man that we live
amongst and handle will be in harmony with nature, will
be reasonable and beautiful: yet all will be simple and
<span class="pagenum">32</span>
inspiriting, not childish or enervating; for as nothing of
beauty and splendour that man's mind and hand may
compass shall be wanted from our public buildings, so in
no private dwelling will there be any signs of waste,
pomp, or insolence, and every man will have his share of
the best.</p>

<p>It is a dream, you may say, of what has never been
and never will be: true, it has never been, and therefore,
since the world is alive and moving yet, my hope is the
greater that it one day will be: true, it is a dream; but
dreams have before now come about of things so good and
necessary to us, that we scarcely think of them more than
of the daylight: though once people had to live without
them, without even the hope of them.</p>

<p>Anyhow, dream as it is, I pray you to pardon my
setting it before you, for it lies at the bottom of all my
work in the Decorative Arts, nor will it ever be out of my
thoughts: and I am here with you tonight to ask you to
help me in realising this dream, this <em>hope.</em></p>
