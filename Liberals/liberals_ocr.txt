ADDRESS TO ENGLISH LIBERALS 1878

N SPEAKING to you as English Liberals 1 shall
I arcely perhaps need to excuse myself if I confess that

Thave from the first looked upon this Eastern Question
chiefly from the point of view of its bearings upon English
interests. I do not mean to say that I looked coldly upon
peoples, who as I thought were struggling for theie liberties
against foreigners, tyrantsand barbarians, or that I thought
it unimportant for the world at large that the wrongs of
poor people, of oppressed people, should be righted after
many years: on the contrary I thought this all important
both to England and to the world at large, and indeed for
this very reason T could not help for evet asking myself
how shall sce deal with the matter; what will England dos
illshe be blind, will ahe be foreseting, will she be ish,
will she be wise?

And if these questions were weighty and worthy of con-
sideration at the time when we first got to know of the
gravity of the Bosnian Insurrection, how much weightier
have they now become when, if all England does not de-
ceive itself, that is threatened which ayia Derby called
the other day the greatest of all English interests: peace.
Sirs, I could scarce have believed till lately that any con-
siderable number of people in England would fora moment
have thought of entering lightly upon any war, even the

 

 

most obviously necessary one: but in these days the utter-
dances ofa part ofthe press, and, Lam grieved vo say if the
Halk of anny people {rues have driven ae it setae

370
Tedging thattherearemen nota few in thiscountry who can
read history and write newspaper articles, and whom
therefore we must set down I suppose as belonging to the
intelligent classes, who desire war for the sake of war:
gentlemen, I have heard a great dealof indignation wasted
upon those who were for peace at any price: what indigna-
tion can be too great to bestow on those who are for war at
any price?

"Now if we found it dificult to imagine that sch a party
could exist, it was perhaps still more dificult to imagine
that it would have adopted the tactics that it has adopted.
‘That it should have gathered to it selfish interests, aristo-
cratic prejudice, love of arbitrary rule, hatred of insurrec-
tion against that rule, contempt of all people not born
within the compass of the narrow seas, that it should have
‘openly formed an alliance in short with all that is reaction-
ary in the country; this we might be certain such a party
would do: but that it should supplement this necessary
part ofits duties by secking allies even in the Liberal party,
and baiting the trap for them with plausible fallacies appeal-
ing to their love of liberty and hatred of absolutism, is a
piece of impudence which one would scarcely have
expected even in the party which Lord Beaconsfield has
chosen to make his own.

‘On one or two of these points I wish to speak to you be-
fore I recur to that threatened danger to English Interest,
which I must again confess lie chiefly at my heart this
evening. These are the people who are always crying out at
us toremember Poland, to remember Hungary: we are not
likely to forget either, I think: noris Russia. [will not make
it'an excuse for her that few nations of Europe are clean-
handed in such matters: I will say rather, that her crimes
have already overtaken her and found her out, since even
‘the very residuum of our reactionary party can dare to
taunt her with them now: I believe that if it had not been
for these crimes of hers all Europe except for national
jealous some reasonable, some unreasonable, would

37

 

 

 
have praised her present enterprise. I would rather accept
the blame in full, and admit that it is natural for men to
doubt her conduct: and then I would bid England look to
it lest she in turn, when she is about some worthy and
laudable enterprise, be taunted with helping Turkey to
ielnilep: Sook: Coen ce ecient
‘Austria to reinslave Hungary.

The plain truth is that it was once the policy of England
to help absolutism to put down insurrection just as it was
of Russia: and this outcry of the greater part of the Tory
party for the bolstering up of falling Turkey is two-thirds
Of it dregs ofthis policy: so much for their sympathy with
Poland and Hungary: Poland is dead, it is safe to sym-
pathise with her: Hungary has gone past them alive, they
can do nothing to her; but Servia, Roumania, Bosnia,
Montenegro are struggling, and they long to end their
struggles in death: long may they live, in spite of that ill-
will, free and progressive.

‘Throughout the nation also this party of war atany price
has strengthened itself by the alliance ofa sentiment which
one can only blame because it looks rather on things than
sees through them: I mean a sympathy, much called forth
by this wars by other wars in our own time, for the weaker
party: the same sympathy with a certain part of the nation
helped the inveterate dislike of freedom (in other people)
‘during the war between the Northern and Southern States
‘of America. Now sympathy with the weaker side has some-
i ee

icely weighed the merits of the case: but in that dispute
between North and South there was a weaker party still
which these sympathetic gentlemen did not think enough

 

 

    

 

 

of: there were in short three parties to the quarrel not two:
the North States, the South States and the slaves. I don't
think that sympathy looks quite as Na we

think of it from that point of view: and

‘of view I call upon you English Liberals, nay uj

372
there are three parties in this quarrel as in most others:
there are the Russians, there are the Turks, and there are
the slaves of the Turks: my sympathies are with the last
of these three. Yes, I must distinctly call them slaves and
not subjects: either actually slaves at present as with the
Bulgarians and others, or newly made freedmen as with the
Rumanians and the Serbs, or lastly people who would be
slaves if they were not heroes as the Montenegrins. This it
is that makes me sad and not exultant when I hear of the
stout fighting, the heroism if you will, of the Turkish
soldiers: I cannot look upon them as men fighting for their
hearths and homes, but rather as landlords fighting for
their unjust rents: lam sorry for them man by man; sorrier
indeed for those thousands that died that morning at
Plevna to satisfy military honour, than Lam for those Rus-
sians whom at the risk of displeasing you I shall call the
martyrs of freedom, who fell last August on the other side
of those fatal ramparts doing their day’s work as gallantly
fs any soldiers ever born: for these last fll helping the
progress of the world, those died striving to hinder it.

they are really only using a geographical name: it is now

jects, Serbs, Wallachians, whatnot, were kept apart from
the rest of the population and sedulously bred up to be
nothing but soldiers, which office they performed to ad-
miration, and as you know, Europe trembled before them
for long. Well if they havesomewhat fallen off in thisart it
is because they have been steadily declining in all ways even
from quite early days, and as I said before, they have
neither learned nor cared to learn any other, but have im-
porteditall ready made. Now, gentlemen, it would certainly
have been a dreadful thing under any circumstances that
the East of Europe should have been invaded and a city
once the capital not of Europe only but the whole world
should have been taken by an alien and barbarous race of
another religion than that of the conquered people; dread-
ful, Isay,and specially perhapsat solate a time in the history
of Europe: nevertheless things like it had happened before,
and pethaps rather than injuring the lands to which they.
had happened, they had strengthened them by adding new
and desirable elements to the population. I must use Eng-
Jand asan illustration: for our land has been conquered four
times, by the Romans, the Saxons, the Danes and the Nor-
mans, and with the exception of the Romans, who came as
soldiers and went as soldiers, those invaders have always
mingled with the population (those of them that they did.
not kill off at once), have strengthened the nation not weak-
ned it: they have altered litte if atall the course of our his-
tory, thetendency of our laws:exceptin those cornersof the
land where the invaders did not come, who can say for cer-
tain of what blood hes? weare ll English together, or if we
belong to those later conquered corners of the land, weowe

hard, I must needs say: but it is much too long ago to re-
member all that except as a story: and as for you, why I
suppose you would find it difficult to pick out people really
of the blood of your conquerors, those Nor ench
with whom you played out that tragedy on the hill slopes
yonder by Hastings: I say we have all mingled and become
Englishmen. So it was with the Normans in Nor
with the Franks in France, with the Lo:
dreadful as the invasions were, time has smoothed all away,
and conquerors and conquered live together peaceably,
scarcely suspecting their origin. How is it that it is not so
in Turkey in Europe, where two millions or thereabout of
Ottomans rule as masters over 6} millions of Christians of
various races? as masters over slaves, I repeat, who ever as
the law of the land yer stands after repeated remonstrances
from the European powers, have no pretence of consider-
ing themselves equal to their masters, and whom in most
cases are customarily dealt with far worse than even the
Jaw gives warrant for? What is it that has caused that
gallant scrap of mountain land Montenegro, the strong-
hold of the Serbs, to fight so desperately against the ove
whelming power of Turkey? what brought about that
desperate, that seemingly hopeless insurrection in Bosnia,
that hapless struggle in Crete, that yet more hapless and
utterly abortive attempt at a rising in Bulgaria avenged b

the half-armed yeomen of Servia to attempt to stand before

whole might of Russia?

375

  

 

  

 

 
another answer to my question than that it is because the
Turkish blood is irreclaimable. 1 doubt that: the Bul-
garians are of Turkish blood also, and I believe them to
be industrious and capable of education and civilization,
though many hard things have been said of them lately; the
Hungarians also are of Turkish blood, and have shown
abundant capabilities for self-government and the real
appreciation of political life; the Turkish families of which
there are many in the island of Negropont or Eubea live
quietly side by side with their Greek neighbours and are
industrious and orderly. I admit that I do not hope for
very high things from the Turkish race for many many
years, even if the best were to happen to them; but no
Goubt they have many good qualities, and if so those quali-
ties must be capable of development. Why is it then that
the Turks during these 500 years have made no steps to-
wards assimilating or being assimilated by their conquered
peoples? Is it because of their religion? I must needs say
that has something to do with it to my mind. I have read a
little of oriental literature (I think I know Lane's Arabian
Nights by heart) and in the course of my studies as an
artist I have come across a good deal of the history of the
East. Since you have heard me say, that you may guess that
Lam not likely to be prejudiced against the East and its
many wonders. Who could read without emotion that
of the life of the prophet and the uprising of the
terrible new religion? or the conquest of Syria with
Kaled’s courage and Omar's glorious simplicity; or the
woful tragedy of the sons of Ali? Who could fail to be
interested in that mass of anecdotal history which the
Arabs have left us with so much told of their great names,
partly sublime, partly trivial? and yet with all that we can-
not help feeling that there is something wanting in their
‘morality, a want of balance and absence of the sense of true
justice. Andalsoas the history gets ater and laterit becomes
2 fearful tale of self-seeking scoundrels and their monstrous
Grimes: even when their Kings have something of the
376

 

 

 

 

 

   
heroic cast in them they lack entirely any political or public
aim; but it becomes a mere struggle for high place because
ofits sordid luxury: more gold more horses more women—
in short like the sailor they want all the rum and baccy in
the world and then a little more rum and baccy. I do not
mean to say that I refer this lack to the profession of Islam;
but rather that Islam was the religion that sprang from
these tendencies, and was then corrupted and acted on by
their results; and there was in all this something exceed-
ingly repulsive to the ideas and hopes of the progressive
West. Let alone that a Moslem living among people of
another religion is almost bound by his religion to look
upon them as his inferiors: so that all things considered I
certainly think the alien religion of the Turks has had much
to do with the undying hatred with which their rule has
been looked on by their—slaves I will call them.
Nevertheless Islam will not account for everything in
the matter: even religious prejudice must give way before
facts: Mr. D. M. Wallace says in his book about Russia
that the Mussulman subjects of the Czar live in perfect
amity with their orthodox brethren, both going to the
same village council, each content with his own mosque
or church, neither side trying to proselytize the other in the
least; and the correspondent of The Times told us the other
day that the Tartars of the Crimea were praying heartily in
their mosques for the success of the Russian arms: per-
haps we must say therefore that the Turks are like fire—
good servants and bad masters. And yet Ido not want them
to be servants either: I no more want to see the Turks
oppressed by the Christians than I do the Christians by the
‘Turks, True, every dog has its day: but nothing grieves me
more in history than to see a fresh brutality take the place
ofan extinct one, and I think we can do better than this.
‘Well then, I do not think that it is merely the race of the
‘Turks that has made their government such a curse to
Eastern Europe, and such a heavy curse to ourselves at
this moment; not their race, though it has been and I think
377

 

  
to-day is bloodthirsty, indolent and libidinous as well
as hardy, patient and dignified; nor is it altogether their
religion, alien as that is from our European ideas, and
though it was always a religion of the sword, and has
grown to be a fosterer of pride and indolence. No, it és
caused partly by these things, but by these things worked
upon by their unlucky position : so it is in private life as you
know: a man has virtues and faults, put him in his right
place and everything goes well, put him in his wrong place,
and his virtues are ill-developed, his faults ill-restrained.
How the Italians used to hate the Austrians, the Tedeschi,
in the days of their tyranny, now thank God gone for ever!
do they hate them now? don’t you remember how the
Venetians feasted the Austrian Emperor the other day, T
have no doubt in all sincerity? What harm was the loss of
Naboth’s vineyard to the Austrians? was it not a gain
rather? Even such a gainful loss I wish may befall the people
of the Ottomans, being, I must tell you, pretty much re-
gardless what loss may befal his Excellency Chefkeet Pasha
and his accomplices. For I must say again that Turkey in
Enurope is a mere geographical nick-name for a set of
peoples now and more or less for many years striving to free
themselves from an army of occupation that call themselves
the Osmanli, who have all the vices of an army: pride of
caste, corruption, ambition, grasping greed; whoarmy-like

Gentlemen: can we be called bad Liberals for not liking
to see an army of occupation sitting down on a country
and eating it up for 500 years? for saying, You have sat
there as an army long enough now? The desire ofthat body
37

 

 

 

 

 

 
which I have the very great honour of representing before
You to-night: to wit the St. James's Hall Fanatics that you
have all heard of, and the desire of the most
statesman of England, the most single-hearted statesman
in the world, the desire of Mr. Gladstone, is that that army
‘of occupation should be broken up, and should exercise
those many virtues of which we have heard at least as much
as enough, in private and under the restraint of equal laws.
We wished that Europe would help in laying down the
conditions under which this should take place: we be-
lieved indeed that in process of time the Ottomans would
cease to govern at Constantinople, or perhaps I should say,
to appear to govern; but we were willing to wait the slow
process of natural decay, determined only to resist the
artifical bolstering up of a tyranny which had lost all life,
all power except for evil. We thought it possible that Eng-
land, setting the example of throwing aside jealousy and
acting firmly and justly in this matter, might have prevented
this terrible war now running let us hope to the dregs.
Were we wrong to hope this? To speak plainly I believe
that if we had had at this crisis a Liberal government
‘nothing less would have happened: nay I believe that had a
patriotic prime-minister been at the head of the Conser-
vative government instead of the shifty place-hunter
that the country to the shame of us all has set there, Europe
‘would have been spared this misery, England, I must needs
say it, this disgrace. We all know that the Marquis of
Salisbury went to Constantinople intending to use the
‘opportunity afforded to us to the best of his power: we
‘well guess how he was foiled. We heard not long ago

-ve in that case that the opportunity that England
ie Constantinople Conference of settling this ques-
tion would not have been wholly lost; though some of us
might have thought the settlement less than wholly satis-
factory. That opportunity has been lost, and we have for
many months been looking on the bloodiest war of our day:
nevertheless that war must, if nothird party interferes, come
to an end soon, and the result of it in that case must be the
practical breaking up of that army of occupation ruled by
corruption and rapacity which is called the Ottoman
government. The end we have desired will be brought
about though at the expense of fearful blood-shedding,
and though the dignity and renown and influence of Eng-
land will by her own fault have suffered.

‘well know, there isa danger ahead before
(9 port: it is now no secret that there are
two parties in the Cabinet as there arein the country: there
isa moderate party that will at least be in no hurry to quar-
rel with Russia, composed of those ministers whom we
respect though we may differ from them; and there is
another party that appears to be ready to quarrel with
Russia and drag us, if they can, into an unjust war either
with pretext or without, and at the head of that party is a
minister whom we do mor respect, my Lord Beaconsfield.
Tt is no use mincing the matter, the whole country knows
by now that such is the case; everybody is putting the ques-
tion, Isit to be peace or war? For my part I believe that such
awar would bea crime, ard I will do my utmost to resist its
taking place, as Tkno% ‘thousands of my.
will do. But at least if itis 2 crime do not let us go into it
‘with our eyes shut: do not let us commit the double crime,
the double folly, of allowing ourselves from sloth and lan-
guor to be dragged into a war that we more than doubt is
unjust. That is the danger that I dread: that we shall

wars: all right and wrong get muddled up together, the
cause and no-cause of the war gets clean forgotten, and men
invent some other cause that they never thought of when
they first went into the war, and no reason is listened to till
peace comes and its reaction: and then people turn round
and look about them and say, What did we do it for? what
wasit all about?

Tentreat you all to do your very utmost to save the nation
from such a misfortune as our going to war with the coun-
try divided against itself: I believe the danger great, but |
believe that if the country in general were quite assured of
the danger it would soon put an end to it, for I am pretty
sure that in spite of its noise the war-party is much in the
minority. Yet even if I am wrong, I would appeal to that
majority and bid them beware before they ventured into a
doubtful war which many thousands of their fellow-
countrymen could call nothing but a crime; in which it
would be hard to say which would be worse, victory or
defeat.

I protest when I think of the ultimate consequences of
our joining with the Turks in this war and defeating the
Russians, I dare not even in imagination face the hideous
confusion that our folly would have created. As for defeat:
{ cannot suppose, whatever disasters we might meet with,
that we should not in the end be called the victors, so great
is the wealth and the manhood of England. But, Isayagain,
what a woful victory would such a war bring us, fought out
to the bitter end; a war in which so many of us could not
‘wish God speed you, to our departing soldiers. It would be
the first time that such a war has happened to us in our
time; I think few people can even imagine what a calamity
it would be. I will say it deliberately it would be only a few

against our liberties, as lay before him who was the helpless
head of the French Plotters: let him submit or demit.

Sirs, I tell you that if this war is waged, it will under
whatever disguises be a war for the suppression of just
insurrection against tyranny. I ask you Liberals to remem-
ber our own liberties, the very spring of successful and
righteous insurrection, and I call upon you countrymen of
Cromwell not to be cajoled by Disraeli into a war which
would he above all things. war of reactionists:ifany of you
Liberals are tempted to think that Russia is your enemy, T
beg to think that you may find enemies of freedom nearer
home than that: enemies who are watchful to seize upon
every opportunity that your mistakes may give them. I
think we have not by a long way finished with reform: we
have worked hard, we have gained much, we have forced
‘our very opponents to help us; shall all these gains, all these
thats of tal and crude be ample into a etal
