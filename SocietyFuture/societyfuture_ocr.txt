THE SOCIETY OF THE FUTURE (Axcoxts,
Maxcuzstzs, 1855)

N MAKING our chims for the changes in Society
Iwmch we believe would set labour free and thus bring

about a new Society, we Socialists are satisfied with
demanding what we think necessary fo that Socety o
form itself, which we are sure it is getting ready to dos this
we think better than putting forward elaborate utopian
schemes for the future. Weassert that monopoly must come.
10 an end, and that those who can use the means of the

roduction of wealth should have all opportunity of dois
ook
wwealth which they have created to an irresponsible owner
of the necessaries to production; and we have faith in the
regenerative qualitis of this elementary piece of honesty,
and believe that the world thus set frec will enter on 2 new
eycle of progress. We are prepared to face whatever draw-
backs may accompany this new development with equa-
nimity, being convinced thatit willatany rate beagreat gain
to have got rid of a system which has at last become nearly
all drawbacks. The extintion of the disabilities of an effete
system of production will not, we are convinced, destroy
the gains which the world has already won, but wil, on the
contrary, make those gains available to the whole popula-
tion instead of confining their enjoyment to a few. In short,
considering the t condition of the world, we have
come to the conclusion that the function of the reformers
now alive is not so much prophecy 2s action. It i our busi-
453

 

 
ness to use the means ready to our hands to remedy the
immediate evils which oppress us; to the coming genera-
tions we must leave the task of safeguarding and of using
the freedom which our efforts shall have won them.

Nevertheless, we do partly know the direction which the
development of the world will takein the immediate futures
the evolution of past history teaches us that. We know that
the world cannot go back on its footsteps, and that men
will develop swiftly both bodily and mentally in the nese
Socicty; we know that men in general will feel the obliga-
tions of Society much more than the later generations have
done, that the necessity for co-operation in production and
lifein general will be more consciously fel than it has been;

that the comparative ease of ife which the freeing of labour
will bring about wil give all men more leisure and time for
thought; that crime will be rarer because there will not be
the same temptation to it; that increased ease of life and
education combined will tend o free us from disease of
body and mind. In short, that the world cannot take a step
forward in justice, honesty and kindliness, without a cor-
responding gain in all the material conditions of lfe.

And besides what we know, 2 knowledge without which
we should not take the trouble to agitate for a change in the
basis of Society, we cannot help guessing at a great deal
which we cannot know; and again, this guessing, these
s st somi oo e
many a man a Socialist whom sober reason deduced from
scienceand political economy and the selection of the fttest
would not move at all. They put 2 man in a fit frame of
‘mind to study the reasons for his hope: give him courage
to wade through studies, which, as the Arab king said of
arithmetic, would otherwise be to0 dull for the mind of
‘man o think of.

Thereare, in fact, two groups of mind with whom Social
Revolutionistslike other people have to deal, the analytical
and the constructive. Belonging to the latter group myself,
Tam fully conscious of the dangers which we incur, and

454

 

 

 
still mor perhaps of the plessures which we lose, and am,
e il i e
setting of us straight when our yearning for action leads us
astray, and [ am also, I confess, somewhat envious of the
beatitude of their dreamy contemplation of the perfection
of some favourite theory; a happiness which we who use
our eyes more than our reasoning powers for noting what is
going oniin the world, seldom or never enjoy.

: ngwevzr, as they would and do call our instinctive
vision dreaming, and as they almost always, at least i their
own estimation, have the better of us in argument when we
‘meet in friendly battle, | must be carcful what I say of
them, and so will for the present at least only deal with the
visionaries or practical peaple. And one thing | must confess
from the beginning, which is that the visions of us visionary
or practical people differ largely from each other, and that
we are not much interested in each others’ visions; whereas
the theories of the analysts diffe littie from cach other, and
they are hugely interested in each others’ theories—in the
way that a butcher is interested in an ox—to wi, for cutting
up.

e Lol ot cupt o oms e sy visicmewith e of
other Socialists, but will simply talk to you of some of my
own, and let you make the comparison yourselves, those
of you who are visionarics, or let you unassisted by me
eriticize them, those of you who are analytically given. In
short, I am going to give you a chapter of confessions. [
want to tell you what it is I desire of the Society of the
Future, justas if I were going to be reborn intoit; | daresay
that you wil find some of my visions strange enough.

One reason which will make some of you think them
strange is a sad and shameful one. I have alsways belonged
to the well-to-do classes, and was born into luxury, so that
Task much more of the future than many of you

dos and the first ofall my visions, and that which coloursall
my others,i of 2 day when that misunderstanding will no
Ionger be possible; when the words poor and rich, though

455

 

  
they will sell be found in our dictionaries, will have lost
their old meaning; which will have to be explained with
care by great men of the analytical kind, spending much
time and many words over the job, and not succeeding in
the end in making people do more than pretend to under-
stand them.

‘Well now, to begin with, I am bound to suppose that the
realization of Socialism will tend to make men happy.
Whatis it then makes people happy? Free and full life and
the consciousness of life. Or, if you will, the pleasurable
exercisc of our energics, and the enjoyment of the rest
which that exercise or expenditure of energy makes neces-
sary to us. I think that is happiness for all, and covers all
difference of capacity and temperament from the most
e oad

Now, whatever interferes with that freedom and fulness
of Jife, under whatever specious guise it may come, is an

s something to be got rid of as speedily as possible. It
ought not to be endured by reasonable men, who naturally
wish to be happy.

Here you see is an admission on my part which I sus-
pect indicates the unscientific mind. It proposes the exer-
cise of free will on the part of men, which the latest scien-
tists deny the possibility of, I believe; but don't be afraid, I
am not going into argument on the matter of free will and
predestination; I am only going o assert that if individual
men are the creatures of their surrounding conditions, 45
indeed I think they are, it must be the business of man as
social animal, or of Society, if you will, to make the sur-
roundings which make the individual man what heis. Man
‘must and does create the conditions under which he lives;
let him be conscious of that, and create them wisely.

‘Has he done so hitherto? He has tried todo so, I think, but
with only moderate success, at any rate at times. However,
the results of that moderate success he is proud of, and he
Sl ke in N e bt s o0
different minds abundant discussion as to: civiliza-

456

 

 

   
tion is a good thing or an evil. Our friend Bax in his very
ablearticleon the subject, did, I think, really put the matter
on its true footing when he pointed out that as 2 step to
something better, civilization was 2 good, but as an
achievement it was an evil. In that sense I declare myselfan
enemy of civilization; nay, since this s to be a chapter of
confessions, I must tel you that my special leading motive
a8 a Socialist s hatred of civilization; my ideal of the new
Society would not be satisfied unless that Society destroyed
civiliz

For if happiness be the pleasurable exercise of our
energies and the enjoyment of necessary rest, it seems to me
that civilization, looked at from the static point of view, as
Bax phrases it tends to deny us both these good things, and
thereby tends to reduce man to a machine without a wil;
to deprive him gradually of all the functions of an animal
and the pleasure of fulfilling them, except the most ele-
mentary ones. The scientific ideal of the future of man
would appear to be an intellectual paunch, nourished by
circumstances over which he has no control, and without
the faculty of communicating the results of his intelligence
to his brother-paunches.

Therefore my ideal of the Society of the future is first of
allthe freedom and cultivation of the individual will, which
civlization ignorcs,or even dries the cxistence ofs the

e slavish dependence, not on other men, but

s systems made to save men manly trouble and
Fesponsibility: and i order that this will may be vigorous
in us, [ demand a free and unfettered animal life for man
first of all: I demand the utter extinction of all asceicism.
If we feel the least degradation in being amorous, or merry,
or B o ot s et s
fore miserable men. And you know civilization dees bid us
to be ashamed of all these moods and deeds, and as far as
she can, begs us to conceal them, and where possible to get
other t0 do them for us. In fact, it seems to me that
civilization may almost be defined 2s a system arranged for

457

 

 

 
ensuring the vicarious exercise of human energies for a
‘minority of privileged persons.

Well, but this demand for the extinction of asceticism
bears with it another demand: for the extinction of luxury.
Does that scem a paradox to you? It ought not to do so.
‘What brings about luxury but a sickly discontent with the
simplejogs of the lovely carth? What i it but a warping of
the natural beauty of things into a perverse ugliness to
satisfy the jaded appetite of 2 man who is ceasing to be a
‘man—a man who will not work, and cannot rest? Shall [
tell you what luxury has done for you in modern Europe?
It has covered the merry green fields with the hovels of
slaves, and blighted the flowers and trees with poisonous
gases, and turned the rivers into sewers; till over many
parts of Britain the common people have forgotten what a
field or a flower is like, and their idea of beauty is a gas-
poisoned gin-palace or a tasdry theatre. And civilization
thinks that is all right, and it doesn’t heed it; and the rich
man practically thinks, "Tis all right, the common people
are used to it now, and so long 2 they can il their bellies
‘with the husks that the swine do eat, it is enough. And all
for what? To have finc pictures painted, beautiful buildings
built, good poems written? O no: those are the deeds of the
ages before luxury, before civilization. Luxury rather
‘builds clubs in Pall Mall, and upholsters them as though
for delcte nvalid Idies, for the behoof of big whiskered
‘men, that they may lounge there amidst such preposterous.
effeminacy that the very plushed-breeched flunkies that
wiit upon the loungers are better men than they are. |
needn’t go further than that:  grand club s the very repre-
sentativeof |

"Wel,you see | dwell upon that matter o luxury, which
is really the sworn foe of pleasure, because | dort want
‘workmen even temporarily to look upon a swell club as a
desirable thing. | know how diffcult it s for them to look
from out of their poverty and squalor to a ife of real and.
manly pleasure; but Lask the o think thatthe good lifeof

458

  
the fiture will be aslitle ik the lfe of the present rich 2s
‘may be: that lfe of the rich is only the wrong side of their
own misery; and surely since it is the cause of the misery,
there can be nothing enviable or desirable init. When our
opponents say, as they sometimes do, How should we be
able to procure the luxuries of lfe in 2 Socialist society?
. Dokl Ve coulih ok oS wud we don'Eeare: for
we don’t want them and won't have them; and indeed, |
feel sure that we cannot if we are all free men together. Free
men, | am sure, must lead simple lives and have simple
pleasures: and if we shudder away from that necessity now,
itis because we are not free men, and have in consequence
wrapped up our lives in such a complexity of dependence
that we have grown fecble and helpless. But again, what is
simplicity? Do you think by chance that I mean 2 row of
yellow-brick, biue-slated houses, or a phalangstere like an
improved Peabody lodging-house; and the dinner-bell
ringing one into row of white basins of broth with 2 piece
of bread cut nice and square by each, with boiler-made tea
and ill-boiled rice-pudding to follow? Nos that's the phil-
anthropist's ideal, not mine; and here I only note i to re-
pudiate it, and to say, Vicarious life once more, and there-
fore no pleasure. No, I say; find out what you yourselves
find pleasant, and do t. You won't be alone in your desires;
you will get pleny to help you in caring themn uty nd
You will develop social life in developing your own special
tendencies.

So, then, my ideal is first unconstrained life, and next
simpleand natural ffe. First you must be free; and next you
‘mustlearn to take pleasure in all the details of life: which,
indeed, will be necessary for you, because, since others will

direct opposition to civilization, which says, Avoid trouble,
{ehichyou can only do by, making other peope ive your
life for you. I say, Socialists ought to say, Take trouble,
‘and turn your trouble into pleasure: that I shall always hold

459
Now let us try to use that key to unlock a few of the
closed doors of the future: and you must remember, of
course,in speaking of the Society of the future, [ am taking
the indulgence of passing over the transitional period—
whatever that may be—that will divide the present from
the ideals which, after all, we mustall of us more or less
form in our minds when we have once fixed our belief in
the regeneratior of the world. And firstas to the form of the
position of people in the new Society—their polifical posi-
tion, soto say. Political society as we know it will have come
10 an end: the relations between man and man will no
longer be that of status or of property. It will no longer be
the hierarchical position, the office of the man, that will be
considered, asin the Middle Ages, nor his property as now,
but his person. Contract enforced by the State will have
vanished into the same limbo as the holiness of the nobility
of blood. So we shall at one stroke get rid of all that side of
artificiality which bids us sacrifice each our own life to the
supposed necessity of an institution which i to take care of
the troubles of people which may never happen: every case
ofclashing rights and desires il be delt with on 8 v
‘merit is, really, and not legally. Private property
of course will not exist as a right: there will be such an
abundance of all ordinary necessaries that between private.
persons there will be no obvious and immediate exchange.
necessary; though no one will want to meddle with matters
that have asit were grown to such and such an individual—
which have become part of his habits, so to say.

Now, as to occupations, we shall clearly not be able to
have the same division of labour in them as now: vicarious
servanting, sewer-cmptying, butchering, letter-carrying,
‘boot-blacking, hair-dressin udmmnfu,-mhm
e toon k- shall s iakeall e
agrecable to ourselves in some mood or to some: who
will take to them voluntarily, e iR
Jepae sltogether. A great many gty oocupsions will
mm:zo... we o

 

 
twiddle on ajug-handle tosellit, but to makeit prettier and
to amuse ourselves and others. Whatever rough or inferior
weares we make, will be made rough and inferior to perform
certain functions of use, and not to sell: as there will be no
slaves, there will be no use for wares which none but slaves
‘would need. Machinery will probably toa great extent have
served its purpose in allowing the workers to shake off
privilege, and will  believe be much curtailed. Possibly the
few more important machines willbe very much improved,
and the host of unimportant ones fall into disuse; and as to
‘many or most of them, people will be able to use them or
not as they feel inclined—as, e.g., if we want to go 2 jour-
ney we shall not be compelled to go by railsa

now, in the interests of property, but may indulge our per-
sonal inclinations and travel in  tlted waggon o on the
hindquarters ofa donkey.

Again, the aggregation of the population having served
it purpose of giving people opportunities of inter-
nication and of making the workers fecl their solidarity,
will also come to an end; and the huge manufacturing dis-
trict will e broken up, and nature heal the horbl scars
that man's heedless greed and stupid terror have made: for
it will no longer be a matter of dire necessity that cotton
cloth should be made a fraction of a farthing cheaper this
year than last. It will be in our own choice whether we will
‘work an extra half-hour a-day more to obtain 2 clean home

Now let us use the key to ualock the door of the educa-
tion of the future. Our present education is purely com-
mercial and political: we are none of us educated to be men,
butsome to be property-owners, and others to be property-
servers, Again | demand the due results of revolution on
the basis of non-ascetic simplicity of life. I think here also
we must get rid of the fatal division-of-fabour system. All
people should learn how to swim, and to ride, and to sail a
boat on sea or river; such things are not arts, they are
merely bodily exercises, and should become habitual in
the race; and also one or two clementary arts of lfe, as car-
pentry or smithying; and most should know how to shoea
horse and shear a sheep and reap a field and plough it (we
should soon drop machinery in agriculture I believe when
we were fre). Then again there are things like cooking and
baking, sewing, and the like, which can be taught to every
sensible person in a few hours, and which everybody ought
to have at his fingers’ ends. All these elementary arts
would be once again habitual, as also | suppose would be.
thearts of reading and writing; asalso | suspect would the
art of thinking, at present not taught in any school or uni-
versity that | know of.

Well, armed with these habits and arts, life would lic
before the citizen for him to enjoy; for whatever line he
might like to take up for the exercise of his energies, he

‘opportunities, and material. Nor for my part would I pre-
scribe for him what he should do, being persuaded that the
habits which would have given him the capacities of a man
‘would stimulate him to use them; and that the process of
the enjoyment of his life would be carried out, not at the
expense of his fellow-citizens, but for their benefit. At pres-
ent, you know, the gains held outas a stimulus to exertion,
toall those who are not stimulated by the whip of the threat
of death by starvation, are narrow, and are mainly the hope

462

 

 

 

 
that the successfully energetic man shall be placed in a
position where he shall not have to exercise his energies:
the boredom of satiety, in short, s the crown of valiant
exertion in civilization. But in a social condition of things,
the gains that would e before the exercisc ofonc's energies
would be various and wide indeed nor do | in the least in
the world belicve that the possibility of mere personal use
would, or indeed could, limit people’s endeavour after
them since men would at last have recognized that it was
their business to live, and would at once come to the con-
clusion that ife without endeavouris dull. Now what direc-
tion that endeavour would take, of course I cannot tell you;
Ican only say that it would be set free from the sordid ne-
cessity to work at what doesn’t please us, which is the be-
setting curse of civilization. The suggestion of a hope [
may, however, make, which is of course personal—which
is that perhaps mankind wil regain their eyesigh, which
they have at present lost to 2 great extent. [ am not herc
alluding to what I believe is also a fact that the number of
people of imperfect mechanical sight is increasing, but to
what I suppose is connected with that fact, namely, that
people have largely ceased to take in mental impressions
the eyes; whereas in times past the cyes were the
great feeders of the fancy and imagination. OF course
people use their eyes to prevent them from tumbling down
stairs or from putting their forks to their noses instead of
0 their mouths, but there as a rule is an end of the use they
are to people. I am in the habit when I o to an exhibition
or 4 picture gallery of noticing their behaviour there; and
asa rule | note that they seem very much bored, and their
wander vacantly over the various objects exhibited to
‘and odd to say, 2 strange or unusual thing never
attracts them, no doubt because it appeals to their minds
chiefly through their eyes; whereas if they came across

familiar, they become interested and nudge each other. If,
&g, ordinary people go to our National Gallery, a:] thing
4

   
which they want to see is the Blenheim Raphacl, which,
though well done, is a very dull picture, at least to anyone
ot an artist; and they do this because they have been told
that the—h'm! the—the—sel, the thief that owned it
managed to squeeze an exorbitant sum of money out of the
nation forit. While, when Holbein shows them the Danish
princess of the sixteenth century yet living on the canvas,
the demure half-smile not yet faded from her eyes; when
Van Eyck opensa window for them into Bruges of the four-
teenth century; when Botticelli shows them Heaven as it
lived in the hearts of men before theology was dead, these
things produce no impression on them, not so much even
as to stimulate their curiosity and make them ask what 'is
all about; because these things were done to be looked at,
and to make the eyes tell the mind tales of the pas, the
present, and the future.

Oragain, in times past, when whatis (I supposeasajoke)
called the Educational Department at South Kensington
was more or less mixed up with the Art Department, [
followed up a group through the wonders of the drift of the
artof past days, and perceived that their eyes never steadied
once on any of these things, but that they brightened up at
‘once when they came across a glass case in which the con-
stituent parts of an analysed beefsteak were neatly
arranged and labelled, and that their eyes devoured little
pinches of nothing in particulr, with & trusing ith in
the analyst which I confess I could not share, as it scemed
ome that it would requir  qite superhuman honestyin
him not tosnatch upa few pinches of road-dust orashes and
ke ther o by o o reconsits substances which i
mmdhm%:mhghmmﬁm object. In litera-
ture you will find the same thing going on, and that those
authors who appeal to our eyes to take in mental impres-
sions are relegated by our most ‘intellectual’ critics to a
second place at least: to pass by Homer and Beowulf and
Chaneet, youwill it taly intcllcenst o8 il
‘mere rhetorical word-spinners and hunters of introspection

 

 

 
above such masters of life as Scott and Dickens, who tell
their tales o our senses and leave them alone to moralize
the tale so told.

Now I have dwelt at some length on this matter of the
eyesight, because to my mind it is the most obvious sign of
the march of civilization towards the intellectual-paunch
stage of existence which | have deprecated already; and
also because I feel sure that no special claim need be made
for the art and literature of the future: healthy bodily con-
itions, a sound and all round development of the senses,
joined to the due social ethics which the destruction of all
slavery will give us, will, | am convinced, 2s a matter of
course give us the due art and literature, whatever that due
‘may turn out to be. Only, if I may prophesy ever so little, [
should say that both art and literature, and especially art,
will appeal to the senses directly, just as the art of the past
has done. You see you will no longer be able to have novels
relating the troubles of a middle-class couple in their strug-
Fle towards social uselessness, because the material for such

literary treasures will have passed way. On the other hand
the genuine tales of msmr, will still be with us, and will,
one might well hope, then be told in a cheerfuller strain
than is now possible. Nor for my part can I doub that art
will appeal to the senses of men now grown healthy: which
‘means that architecture and the kindred arts will again
fourish amongst us as in the days before civlisation.
ivilisation renders these arts impossible, because its poli-
tics and ethics force us to live in a grimy disorderly un-
comfortable world, a world that offends the senses at every
turn: that necessity reacts on the senses again, and forces us
unconsciously to blunt their keenness. A man who notices
e cxternal forms o things mach nowadays must sufe i
South Lancashire or London, must live in a state of per-
combat and anger; and he really must try to blunt
is sensibility, or he will go mad, or kill some obnoxious
person and be for it; and this of course means that
m'c will lly get to be born without this incon-
465

 

 

 

 
venient sensibility. On the other hand, let this irrational
compulsion be removed from us, and the senses will grow
again to their due and normal fuiness and demand expres-

which their exercise gives us, which in
iterature at once sensuous and human.

Well, now I will tryto draw these discursive remarks toa
head, and will give you a more concise and complete idea of
the society into which | would like to be reborn.

Itis 2 society which does not know the meaning of the
words rich and poor, or the rights of property, or law o
legality, o nationality: a society which has no conscious-
ness of being governed; in which equality of candition isa.
‘matter of course, and in which no man is rewarded for hay-
ing served the commaunity by having the power given him
tinjureit.

Itis 2 society conscious of a wish to keep lfe simple, to
forgo some of the power over nature won by past ages in
order to be more human and less mechanical, and willing to
sacrifice something to this end. It would be divided into
small communities varying much within the limits allowed
by due social ethics, but without rivalry between each other,
Iooking with zbhorrence at the idea of 2 holy race.

Being determined to be free, and therefore contented
witha life not only simpler but even rougher than the life of
slave-owners, division of labour would be_habitually
limited: men (and women too, of course) would do their
work and take their pleasure in their own persons, and not
vicariously: the social bond would be habitally and instinc-
tively felt, o that there would be no need to be always

ing it by st forms: the family of blood-relationship
would melt into that of the community and of humanity.
The pleasures of such a society would be founded on the
free exercise of the senses and passions of 2 healthy human
animal, so far as this did not injure the other individuals of
the community and so offend against social unity: no one:
would be ashamed of humanity or ask for anything better
than its due development.

466 .

 

  

  

 
But from this healthy freedom would spring up the
pleasures of intellectual development, which the men of
civilization so foolishly try to separate from sensuous life,
and to glorify atits expense. Men would follow knowledge
and the creation of beauty for their own sakes, and not for
the enslavement of their fellows, 2nd they would be re-
‘warded by finding their most necessary work grow interest-
ing and beautiful under their hands without their being
conscious of it. The man who felt keenest the pleasure of
Iying on the hill-side under a rushen hut among the sheep
on & summer night, would be no less fit for the enjoyment
of the great communal hall with all its splendours of arch
and column, and vaultand tracery. Nor would he who took
10 heart the piping of the wind and washing of the wavesas
e sat at the helm of the fishing-boar, be deadened to the
beauty of art-made music. It is workmen only and not pe-
dants who can produce real vigorous art.

And amidst this pleasing labour, and the rest that went
with it, would disappear from the carth’s face all the traces
of the past slavery. Being no longer driven to death by
anxiety and fear, we should have time to avoid disgracing
the carth with filth and squalor, and accidental ugliness
‘would disappear along with that which was the mere birth
of fantastic perversity. The utterly base doctrine, as Carlyle
has it, that this world is a cockney nightmare, would be
known no more.

But perhaps you may think that Society being thus hap-
pyandat peace, its very success would lead it to corruption
gocemore? Ve, hat might beifmen were ot wachful and

ant; but we have saying that they would be
free, u.dhmw"ﬁ‘z‘.}’mﬂ"‘mm and that
means that they shall be watchful and valiant. The world
will be still, 1 do not deny it; but such men as [
of will surely be fitter to meet its trou-
bles than the d: in our present muddle of authority
and unconscious revolt.

‘mind that would be 2 contradiction in terms, if indeed we
agree that happiness is caused by the pleasurable exercise
of our faculties. And yet suppose the worst, and that the
world did rest after so many troubles—where would be the
harm? | remember, after having been ill once, how pleasant
itwas tolic on my bed without pain or fever, doing nothing
but watching the sunbeams and lstening to the sounds of
life outside; and might not the great world of men, if it
once deliver itself from the delirious struggle for life
amidst dishonesty, rest for 2 little after the long fever and
be none the worse for it?

Anyhow, I am sure it would be the better for getting rid
of its fever, whatever came of it; and sure also that the sim-
plicity of life 1 have spoken of, which some would call
stagnation, would give real life to the great mass of man-
kind, and to them at least would be a well-spring of happi-
ness. Tt would raise them at once to 2 higher level of life,
until the world began to be peopled, not with commonplace
people, but with honest folk not sharply conscious of their
superiority s intellectual’ personsnoware, butself-respect-
ing and respecting the personality of others, because they
would feel themselves useful and happy, that isalive.

And as for the superior people, if such a world were not
good enough for them I am sorry, but am driven to ask
them how they to get on with the present one,
which is worse. I am afraid they would have toanswer, We
like it better because it is worse, and, therefore, relatively
weare better.

Alas] my friends, these are the fools who are our masters
now. The masters of fools then, you say? Yes, 5o it is; let
s cease to be fools then, and they will be our masters no
longer. Believe me, that will be worth trying for, whatever
‘may come afterwards.

Take this for the last word of my dream of what is to be:
the test of our being fools no longer wil be that we shall no
longer have masters.
