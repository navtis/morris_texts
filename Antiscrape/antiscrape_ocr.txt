 

T THE SEVENTH ANNUAL
MEETING OF THE SP.AB, 1 Juw, 1884

Wr of this Society at leaét know the beauty of the
weathered and time-worn surface of an ancient
building, and have all of us felt the grief of seeing
this surface di appear under the hands of a ‘restorer”; but
though we all feel this deeply enough, some of us perhaps
‘may be puzzled to explain to the outside world the full value
of this ancient surface. It not merely that ti in itself pic-
turesque and beautiful, though that is a great deal; neither
isit only that there is a sentiment attaching to the very face
which the original builders gave their work, but dimly con-
scious all the while of the many generations which should
gaze onit; itis only a part of its value that the Stones are felt
 be, as M Ruskin Desutiflly puts i, speaking of soms
hidtoric French building, now probably changed into an
academic modelof its el sef hat they ae fet o be the
ery Stones which the eyes of St Louis saw lifted into their

Jaces.” That sentiment is much, but i is not all; nay itis

ta part of the especial value to which I wish to-day to call
your attention, which value briefly i, that the untouched
Surface of ancient architeéture bears witness to the develop-
ment of man's ideas, to the continuity of hidtory, and, so
doing, affords never-ceasing inétruction, nay education, to
the passing generations, not only telling us what were the
aspirations of men passed away, but also what we may hope
for in the time to come.

Youall know whata different sprit has animated hidtory
in these latter days from that which used to be thought

124

 

 

 

 

 
cenough to give it interest to thinking men. Time was, and
not 50 long ago, when the clever rather than,
historian) made his history surrounded by books whose
value he weighed rather by the degree in which they con-
formed to an arbitrary tandard of iterary excellence, tha
by any indications they might give of being able to afford a
glimpse into the past. So treated, the very books were not
capable of yielding the vast étores of knowledge of history
which they really possessed, if dealt with by the historical
‘method. It is true that for the most part these books were
generally written for other purposes than that of giving
simpleinformation to those to come after; at their honestest
the writers were compelled to look on life through the spec-
tacles thrust on them by the conventional morality of their
own times; at their dishonedted, they were servile flatterers
in the pay of the powers that were. Nevertheless, though
theartof lying has always been sedulously cultivated by the
‘world, and especially by that part of it which lives on the
labour of others, it is an art which féw people attain to in its
perfeétion, and the honest man by the use of sufficient dili-
gence can generally manage to see through the veil of so-
phistry into the genuine life which exidts in those written
records of the past; nay, the very les themselves, being for
the modt part of a rough and simple nature, can often be

solved and precipitated, 5o to say, into historical sub-
stance, into negative evidence of faéts.

But the ical hitorians of whom I have spoken
‘were not fitted for the task; they themselves were cursed
with a fatal though unconscious dishonesty; the world of
hiftory which they pictured to themselves was an unreal
one; to them there were but two periods of continuous or-
der, of organized life: the period of Greck and Roman clas-
sical hiftory was one, the time from the development of the

retrospection into that

 

 
herd of bisons; all the thousands of years devoid of creation,
laden only with mere obstruction, and out of that, as I said,
two periods of perfection, leaping fully equipped like Pallas
from the brain of Zeus. A Strange conception, truly, of the
higtory of the *famous men and our fathers that begat us,”
but one which could not hold out long againgt the natural
development of knowledge and society. The midts of pe-
dantry slowly lified and showed a different pictures i
choate order in the remotest times, varying indeed among
different races and countries, but swayed always by the
same Jaws, moving forward cver towards something that
scems the very opposite of that which it Started from, and
yet the earlier order never dead but living in the new, and
Slowly moulding it to a recreation of its former self, FHow-
different a spirit such a view of history must create it is not
difficult to see. No longer shallow mockery at the failures.
and follies of the past, from a standpoint of so-called civili-
zation, but deep sympathy with its half-conscious aims,

only too sadly conscious of to-day; that i the new spirit of
history; knowledge I would fain think has brought us hu-
‘mility, and humility hogx of that perfeétion which we are
obviously so far shorto

Now, further, as to the instruments of this new know-
Jedge of hiory, e they not chicfy two: udy of ang..
uage and fudy of archacology? that i, o the expression of
men’s ideas by means of speech, and by means of handi-
work, in other words the record of man’s creative deeds. OF
the irét of thesc instruments, deeply as I am interested init,
and especially on the side which, tending towards: R
ive mythology, proclaims so clearly the unity of manind,
of this Lack the knowledge tospeak, evenif [ had the time;,
on the second, archacology, I am bound to speak, as it is
abave all things the function of our Society to keep before
people’s eyes its importance as an indtrument of the tudy
of hidtory, which does in very truth lead us towards the
solution of ll the social and political problems over which
‘men’s minds are busied.

126

 

 

 

 

   

          

   

 

 
Tamall the more bound to speak on this subject because,
in spite of the ascendency which the new spirit of history
has over cultivated minds, we must not forget that many
‘minds are uncultivated, and in them the pedantic spirit tll
bears sway and you will understand that when I speak of
uncultivated minds, I am not thinking of the lower classes,
as we civilly, but too truly, call them, but of many of those
whore n responsible positions, and responsible especially
a5 to the guardianship of our ancient buildings. Indeed, to
meet one conceivable objection, I can underdtand a man
saying that the half-ignorant, half-inétructed, and wholly
pedantic way of dealing with an ancient building i histo
cal also, and I can admit some logic in the objection; de-
Struction is,alasl onc of the forms of growth; indeed those
pedantic hictorians [ have been speaking of had their sharc
also in hidtory, and it is a curious question, which I cannot
follow at present, as to how far their detructive pedantry.
was a sign of trength as compared with our reasonable re-
search and timidity I say that I cannot follow this ques-
tion up, though I think it would lead to conclusions asion-
ishing to some people, and so will content myself with sa
ing tht i he narrownes the wilarity o mind (L know o
other word), which deals with our ancient monuments, as if
Art had no past and is to have no future, be an hictorical
development (and 1 don't gainsay it), so also is the spirit
which animates us to resis that vulgarity: *for this among
the reét was L ordained.”

Now, I am sure that,so far | have carried you with me as
‘members of our Society; you cannot doubt that in one way
or other the surface of an ancient building, the fandling of
theold handicraftsman that is, is most valuable and worthy-
of preservation, and I am sure also that we all fecl instinc-
tively that it cannot be reproduced at the present day; that
the attemptat reproduction notonly deprives us ofa monu=
ment of hiftory, butalso of a work of art. In what follows [
have toattempt the task of showing you that this impossi-
bility of reproduction is not accidental, but is essentil to.
the conditions oflfe at the present day; that it is caused by

127

 

 

 

 

 

  

 

 

  

 

 

 
the results of all paét history, and not by a passing taste o
fashion of the time; and that consequently no man, and no
body of men, however learned they may be in ancient art,
whatever skill in design o love of beauty they may have,
can persuade, or bribe, or force our workmen of to-day to
do their work in the same way as the workmen of King Ed-
ward I did theirs. Wake up Theoderic the Goth from his
sleep of centuries, and place him on the throne of Italy; turn
our modern House of Commons into the Witenagemote
(or meeting of the wise men) of King Alfred the Great; no
less a feat is the restoration of an ancient building.

Now, in order to show you that this is necessary and in-
evitable, 1 am compelled very briefly to touch upon the
conditions under which handiwork has been produced from
theclassical times onwardin doing so I cannot avoid touch-
g on certain social problems, on the solution of which
some of you may differ from me. In that case I ask you to
remember that though the Committee has ordered me to
read this paper to you, it cannot be held responsible for any
opinions outside the principles advocated in its published
documents. The Society should not be regarded as danger-
aus, except, perhaps, to the amusements of certain country

rsons and squires, and their wives and daughters.

Well, it must be admitted that every archite¢tural work
is 2 work of co-operation. The very designer, be he never.
50 original, pays his debt (o this necessity in being in some
form or another under the influence of aditior; dead men
fide i hand v when e forges thatthy cvereifid.

ut, furthermore, he must get hisideas carried out by other
men; no man can build a building with his own hands;
every one of those men depends for the possibilty of even
beginning his work on someone else; each one is but part
of amachine; the parts may be but machines themselves, or
they may be intelligent, but in either case must work in
subordination to the general body. It is clear that men so
‘working must be influenced in their work by their condi-
tions of life, and the man who organizes their labour mugt

128

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 
make up his mind that he can only get labour of a kind
which those conditions have bred. To expect enthusiasm
for good workmanship from men who for two generations
have been accustomed by the pressure of circumétances to
work slovenly would be absurd; to expect consciousness of
beauty from men who for ten generations have not been al-
lowed to produce beauty, more absurd &ll. The workman-
ship of every piece of co-operative work must belong to its
period, and be charadteridtic of it. Understand this clearly,
which I now put in another form: all architeGtural work
muét be co-operative; in all co-operative work the finished
Wares can be no better in quality than the lowest, or sim-
pletyor widedt grade, which i a1so the mot esencil wil
alloy them to be. The kind and quality of that work, the
work of the ordinary handicraftsman, is determined by the
social conditions under which he lives, which differ much
from age toage.

Letus then try to see how they have differed, and glance
atthe results to Artof that difference; during which inquiry
we shall have much more to do with the developed Middie
Ages, with the work of which our Society is chiefly con-
cerned, than with any other period.

In the classical period indutrial production was chiefly
carried on by slaves, whose personsand work alike belonged.

It was natural that under these circum§tances industrialism
should be despised, but under Greek civilization, at least,
‘ordinary lfe for the frc citizens, the aridtocracy in fact, was.
simple, the climate was not exacting of elaborate work for
the purposes of clothing and sheler, the race was yet young,
vigorous, and physically beautiful. The aridtocracy, there.
fore, freed from the necessity of rough and exhausting work.

 

 

 

 

 

by their possession of chattel slaves, who did all that for

them, and litele oppressed with anxieties for their liveli-

hood, had, in spite of the condtant brawling and piracy

which forms their external hiStory, both inclination and
129
leisure to cultivate the higher intellectual arts within the
limits which their natural love of matter of fact and hatred
of romance prescribed to them; the lesser arts, meantime,
being kept in rigid, and indeed slavish subordination to
them as was natural. May I break off here to ask you to con-
sider, in case any Athenian gentleman had attempted to
build a Gothic cathedral in the days of Pericles, what sort
of help he would have had from the slave Iabour of the day,
and what kind of Gothic they would have produced for him
Well, the ideal of art edtablished by the intellect of the
Greckswith such splendid and overwhelming successlasted
throughout the whole Roman period also, in spte of the in-
vention and use of the arch in architeéture, or rather in
building; and side by side with it chattel slavery, under
somewhat changed conditions, produced theordinary wares
of life; the open-mouthed contempt for the results of indus-
trial production expressed by the pedant Pliny, whether it
were genuine or artificially deduced from the convention-
altes o phlosophy, welllfrstes the conditon of the
slave-produced lesser arts of the later classical period.
Meantime, and while Pliny was alive, the inteliectual
arts of classical times had long fallen from their zenith, and
had to wade through weary centuries of academicalism,
from which they were at ladt redeemed, by no recurrence of
individual genius to the earlier and human period, but by

Sonal duies and rights, personal service and protection in

130

 
   

as was natural in this hierarchical syStem, the religious
houses, whose distinét duty it was to hold the hierarchical
ideal up as a banner amongst imperfect men, fulfiled to-
‘wards the arts in the earlier Middle Ages, amidst the field-
serfs and their lords, the fundtion which in classical times
the cultivated Greek free man fulfilled amidst his crowd of
enslaved menials. But the serf was in a very different condi-
tion from the chattel slave; for, certain definite duties being
performed for his lord, he was (in theory at least) a liberty
to earn his living as he best could within the limits of his
manor. The chattel slave, as an individual, had the hope of
‘manumission, but colleétively there was no hope for him
butiin the complete and mechanical overturn of the society.
which was founded on his subjetion. The serf, on the other
hand, was, by the conditions of his labour, forced to Strive
to better himselfas an individual, and collectively soon be-
fen to aquire rights amiddt the clshing rights of king,
Jord, and burgher. Also, quite early in the Middle Ages,
new and mighty force began to germinate for the help of
Iabour, the firét signs of secular combination among free
men, producers, and didtributors.

The guilds, whose firét beginning in England dates from
before the Norman Conquest, although they fully recog-
nized the hierarchical conditions of society, and were indeed.
often in early times mainly religious in their aims, did not
spring from ecclesiadticism, nay, in all probability, had.

cir roots in that part of the European race which had not
known of Rome and her indtitutions in the days of her tem-
poral domination. England and Denmark were the fore-
mott countries in the development of the guilds, which took.
root latest and most feebly in the Latinized countries.

“The spirit of combination spread; the guilds, which at
fieét had been rather benefitsocieties or clubs than anything.
else, soon developed into bodies for the protection and free-
dom of commerce, and rapidly became powerful under the
‘name of merchant guilds; in the height of their power there
formed under them another set of guilds, whose object was

130

  

 

 

 

      

 

 

   

 

 

 
the regulation and praétice of the crafts in freedom from
feudal exactions. The older merchant-guilds resisted these
newer indtitutions; so much so that in Germany there was
bloody and desperate war between them; the great revolt of
Ghent, you will remember asan illuétration of this hostility,
was furthered by the lesser crafts, as Froissart calls them;
and again remember that Ghent, the producing city, was
revolutionary, Bruges, the commercial one, reactionary. In

ingland the merchant-guilds changed in a more peaceable
manner, and became in the main the corporations of the
towns, and the craft-guilds took their definite place as regu-
lators and proteétors of all handicrafts. By the beginning of
the fourteenth century the supremacy of the craft-guilds
was complete, and at that period at least their constitution
was thoroughly democratic; mere journeymen there were
none, the spprentice werebure 43 & mates of course, to
take their places as masters of their craft when they learned
it.

Now before we g0 on to consider the decline and fall of
the guilds, let us look at the way which the craftsman
worked at that period  and firét a word as to his conditions
of life: for | musttell you very briefly that he lived, however
roughly, yet at leaét far easier than his successor does now.
Heworked for no master save the public, he made his wares
from beginning to end himself, and sold them himself to
the man who wasgoing o e them. This wisth case st
least with nearly all, if not all, the goods made in England,
some of the rarer goods, such as silk cloth, did come into
the chaffering market, which had to be the case all the more:
for this, that the materials of any country were chiefly
wrought into goods close to their birthplace. But even in
the cases of these rarer goods they were made primarily for
home consumption, and only the overplus cume into the
hands of the merchant; concerning which latter you must
also remember that he was not a mere gambler in the hay
hazard of supply and demand as he i to-day, but an in
pensabledidtributor of goods: he was paid for his troublein

132

 

 

     
  

 

  
bringing goods from a place where there was more than -
wasneeded ofthem toa country where there was notenough,
and that was all;the laws againdt forestallers and regratters
givean idea of how this matter of commerce was looked on
in the Middle Ages, as commerce, viz., not profitmonger-
ing. A foredtaller was 2 man who bought up produce to hold
it for a rise, a regratter, a man who bought and sold in the
same market or within five miles of it. On the advantages of
the foredtaller to the commaunity it i scarcely necessary to.
dwell, 1 think: as to the regratter, it was the view of the be-
nighted people of the Middle Ages that aman who bought,
say, a hundred-weight of cheese for 2d. a pound at nine in
the morning and sold it at eleven for 3d. was not a specially
useful citizen. I confess 1 am sufficiently old-fashioned and
conservative to agree with them on that head, although 1
cannot help perceiving that all *business,” properly so call-
ed,is now fore@talling and regratting, and that weareall the
slaves of those delightful and simple professions—so that
the criminals of one age have become the benevolent mas-
ters of the next.

Well, anyhow, it followed from this direct intercourse
betsween the makerand the consumer of goods, that the pub-
licin general were good judges of manufactured wares, and,
in consequence, that the art, or religion rather, of adultera
tion was scarcely known; at least, it was easy to win the
fame of a confessor, if nota martyr, of that noble creed.

Now, a5 to the manner of work, there was litle or no
division of labour i each craft; that  think is some it
tion of the evil, for Llook upon itas such, of a man beiny
Bl o o maccrat o i it ong (G he s now sy
—some mitigation, because, after all, there was plenty of
variety in the work of a man who made the whole of a piece
‘of goods himself, instead of making always ane lttle piece
ofa piece. Also youmust note that the freemen of the guilds
had their share in the Tands of the country, as every.
free man atleast had. Port Meadow, at Oxford, for instance,
‘was the communal pasture of the freemen of that city.

133

   

  

 

 

  

 

  
‘These were the conditions of life and work of the English
craftsmen of the fourteenth century. I suppose most of us
have declined to accept the picture of him which we have
had presented to us by the half ignorant and wholly mis-
leading pedants of whom I have spoken before, We who
have studied the remains of his handicraft have been, with-
out any further rescarch, long inétinétively sure that he was
no prieét-ridden, down-trodden savage, but a thoughtful
and vigorous man, and in some sense, at eadt, free. That in-
§tinét has been abundantly confirmed by painstaking col-
lectors of faéts, like Mr Thorold Rogers, and we now know
that the guild craftsman led the sort of lie in work and play
that we should have expected from the art he produced. He
‘worked, not for the profit of a master, but for his own live-
lihood, which, I repeat, he did not find it diffcult to earn, so.
that he had a good deal of leisure, and being master of his
time, his tools, and his material, was not bound to turn out
his work shabbily, but couldafford to amuse himself by giv-
ing it artidtic finish; how different that is from mechanical
or trade finish some of s, at least, have learned—maybe, by
theway of Weeping Cross. Well thatartidtic inish or orna-
ment was not venal, it was given freely to the public, who, |
rather think, paid for it by intereét in and sympathy for the
work itself, which, indeed, I consider a good payment in
times when a man could live otherwise without payment
more gross and material. For here I must make the confs-
sion that what is caled in modern slang the ‘wages of gen-
ius,” were much neglected by the biahiets of GianRer
buildings; for art, as Mr Thorold Rogers justly says, was
‘widespread; the possession of some skill i it was the rule
and not the exception. As a rule, those who could afford to
pay fora building, were abletodo the necssry planning
and designing, obviously because they would naturally fi
help and harmonious intelligence among the men they had
to employ. For inftance, the tower of Merton College
Chapel at Oxford was carried out by ordinary masons, un-

judging from the wretched tinkering that the present Fel-
Tows have allowed to be perpetrated on their beauiful suc-
cursal house, St Albans’ Hall, I would not venture to trust
the present most respectable Fellows of that ancient House
with sucha job now.

Soit followed from this widespread skill in the arts, that
those poor wretches who had skil and taste beyond their
fellow-workmen, and who in consequence had pleasanter
work than they, had to put up with a very moderate addi-
tional wage, and in some cases with nothing additional it
seems they could not make good the claim now preferred
for that much sinned against—and much sinning—com-
pany, men of genius, that the conformation of their sto-
machs and the make of their skin is different from that of
other men, and that consequently they want more to eatand
drink and different raiment from their fellows. In most so-
ber carnet, when we hear it said, as it often is said, that
extra money payment s necessary under all circumétances
0 prodicegeeat works of art, and that men of specal lent
will not use those talents without being bribed by mere
gross material advantages, we, I say, shall know whit to re-
P: Wecan appel to e itnss of those lovely vorks il

eft o us, whose unknown, unnamed creators were content
togive them to the world, with little more extra wages than
‘what their pleasure in their work and their sense of useful-
ness i it might bestow on them.

Well, [ must now say that it seems to me that a body of
artificers, so living as we have seen, and so working, with
simple machines or inétruments, of which they were com-
plete masters, had very great advantages for the production
of archite¢tural art, using that word at its widedt; and that
‘one would, reasoning a prir o find in their work
that thoughtfulness End’fauhlyg??mnrce, that blended
freedom and harmonious co-operation, which, as a matter
of fa, we do find in it. Nevertheless, in spite ofthis free in-
telligence of the medieval workman, or even because of it,
‘hewas ill compelled to work only as tradition would allow

135

 

 

 

  

 

 
him to do. Ifit could ever have occurred to any man's mind
0 build some new Parthenon or Ereétheum by the banks
of Thames, or Warfe, or Wensum, in the fourteenth cen-
tury, how far do you think his fellow-workman’s skill would
have been able to second his foll

But we must leave the fourteenth century awhile, and
hurry on in our tale of the workman’s lot. | have said that
the condtitution of the crafi-guild was at firét thoroughly
democratic or fraternal, but it did not long remain so. As
the towns grw bigger and popultion lowed tothem from
theenfranchised field-serfsand other sources, theold crafts-
men began to form a separate and privileged class in the
guilds with their privileged apprentices, and the journey-
‘man at ladt made his appearance. After a while the journcy-
men attempted to form guilds under the madter crafts, as
the latter had done under the merchant-guilds; but the eco-
nomic conditions of the time tending now more and more
towards manufaéturing for a profit, beat them, and they
fled. Nevertheless, the conditions of work did not change
much; the madters were checked by laws in favour of the
journeymen, and wages rather rose than fell all through the
ifteenth century; nor did division of labour begin till much
laters everywhere the artisan was still an artist.

The beginning of the great change came with the Tudors
in the firét quarter of the sixteenth century, during which
time England, from being a country of tillage cultivated for
livelihood, became a grazing country farmed for profit. He

the wanton dedtruction of our public buildings which ac
‘companied the Stealing of our public lands, doubtless play
edits partin degrading whatart was &ill possible under the
new conditions of labour.

But the Reformation itself was but one of the aspects of
the new spirit of the fime produced by great cconomical
changes, and which dealt with art and its creator, labour,
far more completely than any series of accidents could do,
however momentous they might be. The changein the con-
ditions of labour went on speedily, though there was &till
a good deal of what may be called domestic manufacture;
the workmen in the towns got to be more dependent on
their employers, more and more mere journeymen, and a
great change was coming over the manner of their work;
the mere collection of them into big workshops under one
magter, i itself mercly gave economy of space, rent, fire,
lighting, and the rest, but it was the prelude to a much
greater change: division of lsbour now began, and speedily
gained head. Under the old medieval conditions the unit
of labour was a madter craftsman who knew his business
from beginning to ends such help as he had was from mere
apprentices who were learning their business, and were not
doomed to lfe-long service. But with the new system of
magter and men came this change, that the unit of produc-
tion wasa group, each member of which depended on every
one of the others, and was helpless without them. Under
this system, called the division of labour system, a man may
e, and often s, condemned for the whole of his ife to make
the insignificant portion of an insignificant article of the
market, T use the present tense, because this system of divi-
sion of labour is tll going on side by side with the lact de-
velopmentof manufacturing for profit, of which moreanon.

the economical changes which forced men to produce no
longer for a livelihood as they used to do, but for a profit.
Almodtall goods, all except those made in the most domes-
tic way, had now to go through the market before they
seached the users’ hands. They were made for sale, not pri-
marily for use, and when I say they," I mean the whole of
them the art in them as well as their mere obvious ulity
was now become a marketable article, doled out according
0 the necessities of the capitalét who employed both ma-
chine-workman and designer, fettered by the needs of pro-
fit; for by this time, you underétand, the division of labour
had so worked, that inétead of all workmen being artidts, as
they once were, they were divided into workmen who were
not artists, and artiéts who were not workmen.

‘This change was complete, or nearky so, by the middle of
the eighteenth century: it is not necessary for me to trace
the gradual degradation of the arts from the fifteenth cen-
tury to this point, Suffice it to say that it was dteady and cer-
tains only where men were more or less outside the great
&tream of civilization, where life was rude, and production
wholly domedtic, did the art produced retain any signs of
human pleasure: elsewhere pedantry reigned supreme. The
pi€ture-painters who were wont to show us, as through win-
dows opened by them, the longings and lives of the saints
and heroes, nay, the very heavens and city of God hanginy
over the earthly city of their love, were turned, what few of
them were aught else than pretentious daubers, into courtly
Hatterers of ill-favoured fine ladies and Stupid supercilious
lords. As for the architeGturalarts, what could you expect to
gexofthem from asetofhuman rmachines,cooperaing i

d, but only for speed and precision of produétion, and
designed for at bedt by pedants who despised the life of
man, and at worst by mechanical drudges, litle better in
any way than the luckless workmen? Whatever might be
ex nothing was got but that mass of foolish toys and
costly ministrations to luxury and ostentation, which has
since those days been most worthily contemned under the
‘name of uphol&tery.

1s that the end of the Story of the degradation of the arts ?
No, there is another act to the drama; worse or better ac-
cording as to whether you are contented to accept itas final,
or have been &timulated to discontent, that is, hope for
something better. I have told you how the workman was re-
duced toa machine, T have 4l to tell you how he has been
pushed down from even that giddy eminence of self-re-
spect.

AX the close of the cighteenth century England was a
country that manufactured among other countries that
manufaétured: her manufactures were &till secondary to her
merely country life, and were mixed up with it; in fifty
years all that was changed, and England was the manufac-
turing country of the world—the workshop of the world,
often so called with much pride by her patriotic sons. Now
this Strange and most momentous revolution was brought
about by the machinery which the chances and changes of
the world, too long atale even to hint at here, forced on our
population. You must think of this great machine industry
as though on the one hand merely the full development of
the effeéts of producing for profit indtead of livelihood,
which began in Sir Thomas More's time, yet on the other
as a revolutionary change from that of the mere division of
labour, The cxigencies of my own work have drven me to
dig pretty deeply into the &irata of the eighteenth-century
‘workshop system, and I could clearly see how very different
itis from the faétory syétem of to-day, with which itis com-
‘monly confounded; therefore it was with a ready sympathy
Fiat 1 et he Bl splamtion of the change and It ten-
dencies in the writings of a man, I will say a great man,
whom, I suppose, I ought not to name in this company, and.
who cleared my mind on several points (also unmentionable
here) relating to this subjeét of labour and its products. But
this at leadt [ must say, that whereas under the cighteenth-
century division of labour syStem, a man was compelled to
‘work for ever ata tifiing picce of work in a base mechanical
wiay, which, also,in that base way he understood, under the

which we now live, he may change his work often enough,
may beshifted from machine to machine, and scarcely know
that he is producing anything at all: in other words, under
the cighteenth-century syétem he was reduced toamachine;
under that of the present day he s the slave toa machine. It
is the machine which bids him what to do on pain of death.
by étarvation. Yes, and by no means metaphorically soj the
machine, for inétance, can, if it pleases, if it chooses fo
hurry, make him walk thirty miles a day inétead of twenty,
and send him to the workhouse if he refuses.
Nov if you ask me (s a by-question) which s the wordt
off, the machine workman of the eightcenth century or the
slave to the machine of the nineteenth, I am bound to say
that I think the former is. If I gave you my reasons, fexe of
you would agree with me, and I am not sure that you would
allow me to fnish this discourse: at any rate they are some-
what complicated. But the quedtion as fo which set of work-
men produced the better work can be answered with little
complication. The machine workman hadto be wellskilled
in his contemptible task at least, the slave to the machine

in the work goes in the overlooking of the labours of these.
latter. In shoet, the present system of the factory and its do-
‘minating machine tends to doing away with skilled labour
altogether.
ere, then, is a étrange contrast, which [ moft seriously
invite you to consider, between the craftsman of the Middle
Ages and him of to-day. The medieval man sets to work at
his own time, in his own house; probably makes his tool,
inétrument, or simple machine himself, even before he gets
‘on to his web, or his lump of clay, or what not, What orna-
ment there shall be on his finished work he himself deter-
mines, and his mind and hand designs it and carries it out;
tradition, that s to say the minds and thoughts of all work=
en gone before, this, inits concrete form of the custom of
his craf, does indeed guide and help him; otherwise he is

fields and sweet country come close up to his house, and he
at whiles occupies himself in working in them, and more
than once or twice in his life he has had to take the bow or
‘brown-bill from the wall, and run his chance of meeting the
great sccret face to face in the ranks of battle; oftencst, in-
deed, in other men's quarrels, yet sometimes in his own,
nor wholly unsuccessfully then.

But he who has taken his place, how does he work and
live? Something of that we all know. There he has to be at
the factory-gates by the time the bell rings, or he is fined or
‘sent to grass.' Nay, not always will the faétory-gate open
to him; unless the master, controlled himself by a market
of which he knows little and the hand nothing, allows him
space to work in and a machine to work at, he mu& turn
back and dkncck bm}l l:u ;;r:cls, as many thousands are
doing to-day in England. But suppose him there, happy

in, day out, and what thoughts he has must be
something else than his work. I repeat, 'is as much as he
can do to know what thing the machine (not he) is making.
Design and ornament, what has he to do with that? Why,
b may betending 8 machine which makes  decent iece
of work, or, on the other hand, may be an accomplice (1
‘very small one) in turning outa blatant piece of knavery and
impodture; he vill get as much wages for one as the other,
nor will one or the other be in the least degree within his
control. All the religion, morality, philanthropy, and free-
dom of the nineteenth century, will not help him to escape
that disgrace. Need [ say how and where he lives? Lodged
in a sweltering dog-hole, with miles and miles of similar
dog-holes between him and the fair fields of the country,
which in grim mockery is called *his.” Sometimes on holi-
days, bundled out by train to havea lookatit, to be bundled
into his grimy hell again in the evening. Poor wretch!

“Tell me, then, at what period of this man’s working life
will you pick him up and set him to imitating the work of
the free crafts-guildsman of the fourteenth century, and ex-
pedt him to turn out work like his in quality >

Well, not to weaken my argument by exaggeration, 1 ad-
mit that though a huge quantity of would-be artidtic work
is done by this slave of the machine at the bidding of some
ridiculous market or other, the crafts relating to building
have not reached that point in the indudtrial revolutions,
they are an example of my assertion that the eighteenth.
century division of labour system éill exists, and works side
by side with the great factory and machine syStem. Yet
here, too, the progress of the degradation is obvious enough,
since the similar craftsmen of the eighteenth century still
had lingering among them scraps of tradition from the.
times of art now lodt, while now in those crafts the division
of labour syétem ha deep, from the architeét to the.
hodman, and, moreover, the dandard of excellence, so far.
from its bearing any relation to that of the free workman of
the guilds, has sunk far below that of the man enslaved by
division of labour in the eighteenth century, and is not @
whit better than that of the shoddy-maker of the great in-
dustries; in short, the workman of the great machine indus-
try s the type of labourto-day.

Surely it is a curious thing that while we are ready to
Jaugh a the idea of the possibility of the Greek workman
turning out a Gothic building, or a Gothic workman turn-
ing outa Greek one, we see nothing preposterous n the Vic-
torian workman producing a Gothicone. Andthis,although
we have any amount of specimens of the work of the
naissance period, whose workmen, under the pedantic and.
retrospective direction of the times, were theoretically sup-
posed to be able to imitate the ancient classical work, which
imitation, as a matter of fact, turned out obstinately charac-
teritic o their own period, and derived all the merit it had
from those charateristics: a curious thing, and perhaps of
all the signs of weakness of art at the present day one of
the most discouraging. I may be told, perhaps, that the.

‘hictorical knowledge, of which I have spoken above,
and which the pedantry of the Renaissance and eighteenth.
century lacked, has enabled us to perform that miracle of

42

 

 

   

 

 

   

  

 
raising the dead centuties to ife again. But to my mind tis
a ftrange view to take of hitorical knowledge and insight,
thatitshould setus on the adventure of trying to retrace our
Steps towards the padt, rather than give us some glimmer
of insight into the future; a étrange view of the
of hitory, that it should make us ignore the very changes
which are the essence of that continuity: In truth, the art of
the padt cycle, that of the Renaissance, which flickered out
at 1ast in the feeble twaddle o the dilettantism of the latter
Georges, had aboutit, as  hinted above, a supereilious con-
fidence in itself, which entirely forbade it o accept any imi-
tation of étyle but one, as desirable, which on was that
which it regarded as part of itself, It could make no more
choice in étyle than Greek or Gothic art could; it fully, if
tacitly, admitted the evolution of hitory, accepted the divi-
sion-of-Jabour workman, and so, indeed, did its best, and
had a kind of ife about it, dreary as that life was, and ex-
pressive enough of the &tupid but fearless middle class do-
‘mination which was the essence of the period.

Butwe, | say, we refuse toadmit the evolution of hictory.
We set our slave to the machine to do the work of the free
medieval workman or of the man of the transition period.
indifferently. We, if no age clse, have learnt the trick of
masquerading in other men's caét offclothes, and carry on &

10 shut our eyes o everything seriously disagreeable, nor
heeding the silent movement of real history which is stil
going on around and underneath our rarce show.

Surely such a State of things is a token of change—of
change, speedy perhaps, complete certainly: of the visible.
end of ane cycle and the beginning of another. For, trange
10 say, here is.a society which on its cultivated surface has.

on their side to edtablish 2 convention of many, which
should rule the world, despite of history and logic, ignoring
necessity which has made even their blind feebleness what it
is. And all the while beneath this cultivated surface works
the great commercial syétem, which the cultivated look on
as their servant and the bond of society, but which really is
their master and the breaker-up of society for it s n itself
and in its essence a war, and can only change its character
with its death: man against man, class againt class, with
this motto, “What I gain you lose,’ that war mut goon till
the great change comes whose end is peace and not war.
And what are we, who are met together here after seven
years of humble ériving for exiétence, for leave to dosome-
thing? Mere étraws in that ocean of half-conscious hypo-
crisy which s called cultivated society ? Nay, I hope not, At
Teaét, we do not tuen round on history and say, This s bad
and that is good I like this and [ don't ike that; but ather
we say, This was life, and these, the works of our fathers,
are material signs of it. That lfe lives in you, though you
have forgotten it; those material signs of it, though you do,
ot hecd thrn, will one day be sought for: and it ncess
sity which is even now forming the society of the time to.
be, and shall one day make it manifest, has amongst other
things forced us to do our best to treasure them, these to-
kens ofife past and present. The society of to-day, anarchi-
calasitis, is nevertheless forming a new order of which we
in common with all those who, L wil say i, have courage to
accept realties and rejeét shams, are and must be, a part;
so that in the long run our work, hopeless as it must some-
times seem to s, will not be utterly lost. For, afterall, what
s it that weare contending for ? The reality ofart, that is to
e e L o
commercial or competitive society, which has been develop-
e e e
tion of the pleasure of life. But that competitive society has
at laét developed itself so far that, as | have said, its own
change and death is approaching, and as one token of the
4t

 

 

 

   

 

 
change the deétruction of the pleasure of life is beginning
t0scem to many of s no longer a necessity but thing to be
Striven againd. On the genuineness and reality of that hope
the exiétence, the reason for exidtence of our Society de-
pends. Believe me, it will not be possible for a small knot of
cultivated people to keep alive an intereét in the art and re-
cords of the padt amidst the present conditions of a sordid
and heart-breaking &ruggle for exiétence for the many, and
a languid sauntering through ife for the few. But when so-
ciety is so reconstituted that all citizens will have a chance
ofléading alife made up of due leisure and reasonable work,
o e e
proted ancient buildings from all damage, wanton or acci-
dental, for then at laét they will begin to understand that
they are part of their present lives, and part of themselves,

il e e the Ginc s ripe for it; for at present
even if they knew of their loss they could not prevent it,
since they are living in a tate of war, that s to say, of blind
waste.

Surely we of this Society have had this truth driven home
ptslily S encngh, hive oten hat o confss thar of
the destruction or brutification of an ancient monument of
atand hiffory was ‘a mate of money’ t was opeless
Giriving against it. Do not let us be so fecble or cowardly as
to refuse to face this fact, for, for us also, although our func-
tion in forming the future of society may bea huml
there is no compromise. Let us admit that we are living
the time of barbarism betwixt two periods of order, the.
order of the past and the order of the future, and then,
though there may be some of us who think (as | do) that the
end of that barbarism is drawing near, and others that it is
far diftant, yet we can both of us, I the hopeful and you the.
unhopeful, work together to preserve what relics of the old
order are yet lefc us for the inétruction, the pleasure, the
‘hope of the new. So may the times of present war be less
disastrous, if but a little—the times of coming peace more.
