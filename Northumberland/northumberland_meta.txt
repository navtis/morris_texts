1. Horton speech:

"We spoke from one waggon Fielding of the SDF in the chair,(179) then Mahon then me then Hyndman then Donald. It was a very good meeting: the front ranks sat down to let the others hear and see. The audience listened intently and were heartily with us: they began by objecting to the reporters, and cried out to 'pit them out' unless they put all down. They hooted the police lustily when I said something about those worthies;(180) being much excited by the news of J. Williams' arrest in London the day before, as he has been down speaking to them.(181) I note that my speech as given in the Chronicle is verbatim almost; as I fancy is Hyndman's, but Donald I thought made the speech of the occasion."

2. Ryton speech:

it is a piece of rough healthy ground by the Tyneside under the bank by which the railway runs: it is a pretty place and the evening was lovely: a mere recreation ground with swings and merry-go-rounds.(184) But we had a very fair meeting there of most attentive persons, though I guess I tried their patience as I got 'lectury' and being excited went on and on till I had gone on too long: however it was successful and the audience stayed till it was nearly dark, gave three cheers for the Socialists and off we went back.
