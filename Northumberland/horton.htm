<h2>THE GREAT DEMONSTRATION AT HORTON. SPEECHES BY MESSRS. MORRIS AND HYNDMAN.</h2>

<p>A mass meeting of the Northumberland miners and other workmen was held yesterday
afternoon, at Horton, near Cramlington, for the purpose of forwarding the
cause of Socialism.</p>

<p>The men attending the meeting were, for conveniences sake, separated
into two divisions. The first contingent assembled at Blyth. and included the
men from the surrounding neighbourhood. They were addressed in the market
place by Mr. Wm. Morris and Mr. J. H. Mahon, after which a move was made
towards Horton. The wood division congregated at Dudley Colliery, and was made
up principally of miners from Burradon, Seaton Burn, and Dinnington. Mr. J.
Fielding delivered a brief address, and the men then marched to Horton. Each
division, during its progress, was increased by the addition of a number of
miners from the villages through which it passed.</p>

<p>The demonstration was held in
a spacious field in the parish of Horton, easy of access to people living in
the large group of colliery villages that lie around. The place is within
comfortable walking distance of Cramlington, Blyth, Bebeide. Bedlington,
Newsham, New Delaval, Dudley, Burradon, Seaton Burn, Dinnington, and numerous
other localities. The afternoon was fine and warm, and the demonstration
combined the pleasure of an outing with the more serious occupation of
discussing great social questions. The commencement of the meeting was fixed
for two o'clock, but long before that hour crowds of people began to find their
way. singly and in groups, from all directions ; and, before the arrival of the
processions from Dudley and Blyth, the field was occupied by a considerable
crowd of people, who lay at ease on the grass, basking in the warm
sunshine. The division from Dudley and Annitsford, with its banner and band, was the
first to arrive; and, twenty minutes later. the Blyth contingent, which also
was preceded by a banner and band, came into the field. It had originally been
intended that speeches should be delivered from two platforms, but the
promoters decided to mass the people into one great meeting, over which Mr. J.
Fielding presided. A trolley was provided. and when Messrs. H. M. Hyndman, J.
Mahon, William Morris, J. Fielding, and A. K. Donald took up their positions
upon it, they were loudly cheered. When the proceedings began, there could not
have been fewer than six or seven thousand people standing and sitting around
the extemporised platform. These included several women, who appeared to take
no less interest in the proceedings than their husbands and brothers. No
placards were exhibited, with the exception of one in which the Union of Mr.
Gladstone is represented by two firmly clasped bends, and that of Lord
Salisbury by two heads fastened at the wrists by iron links.</p>

<p>The CHAIRMAN. who
was received with cheers, said he was glad to see such a gathering of sturdy
North-Country men. It was quite evident that the workers in this part of the
country thought that their only hope of getting the full reward of their
labour was to combine so as to show the capitalists they had got the power,
and would no longer be ground down as they bad been in the past. He had one
piece of information to give them which would make some of them rather sorry.
Some of them had heard John Williams speak, and he might tell them that John
Williams at the present moment was in gaol, and he was sure that they would
be, at that meeting, as ready to protest against attempted coercion in
England as against coercion in Ireland. (Cheers.) The real position of the
Northumberland miners, they found, was not understood by the workers
throughout the land that was one reason why they had not raised their voices
in a loud manner and showed their sympathy with them The Socialists were determined
to go back to London and let the working classes there know that the
Northumberland miners had been very much misrepresented. They had seen for
themselves what the miners were, and saw that they were steady, industrious,
thoughtful, intelligent men, and they were determined to let the rest of the
people in the South of England know that the Northumberland miners had been
fighting an uphill battle in a most courageous manner. (Cheers.)</p>

<p>Mr. J. L. Mahon moved :</p>

<p><em>That we call the attention of the workers throughout the country to the
infamous attempt of the capitalists to reduce the starvation wages we have
been receiving for the past few years, and we demand the practical help of all
workers in our present struggle.</em></p>

<p>He said people were not aware of the position and the fight which the miners
had been engaged. They were told that the miners got 5s. 3d. a day for 6 days
in the week, and on the seventh day, it they wanted it. From these lying
concoction, compiled by government statisticians.  people were lead to believe
that the population were very well off indeed, and that there was no reason
for discontent on their part. If they came down here, and tried to do the work
that the miners were doing, and if they got no more for it, they would very
soon have plenty of reason for being discontented (Cheers.)</p>

<p>They had not raised their voices in sympathy with the miners, because they were
unaware of the great and gallant fight that had been carried on here. He
complained of the indifference of the labour representatives in Parliament,
who, he said, sat sucking their thumbs from one end of the year to the other,
and never thought about the men whom they represented.  The Socialists were
told that if they spoke against these men they would make themselves unpopular.
This was no reason that would deter them from speaking against them They spoke
against them, or, rather. against their action, because they thought they had
acted in a most contemptible and spiritless manner towards the labourers in the
fight they were now engaged in. (Cheers.) They were all here when they had a
picnic, but they were all away when they were wanted to do anything real. (A
voice: "That's true," and cheers.) The great obstacles that stood in the way of
the progress of the working man were—first, the apathy, and very often
downright duplicity, of those who pretended to be the leaders of labour; and,
secondly. the want of education in the greet economical questions. They might
lose in their strike, but they had shown that they were a body of men that the
leaders might be proud of, instead of seeming to be ashamed of. If they failed,
it would be because they had not got all the help, and the advice and the
strength that they ought to have got from the men whom they had raised into a
high position In the days gone by—it would not be their fault, but because the
generals had deserted to the enemy. (Cheers.) They (the Socialists) intended to
go through the country and organise the men everywhere. They must try and make
England a place where every man could get a living who worked for it, and where
no man should be allowed to loaf about, without doing any work at all.
(Cheers.)</p>

<h3>SPEECH BY MR. WILLIAM MORRIS.</h3>

<p>Mr. Wm. Morris, of London, seconded the resolution. Sometimes, he said, when he
was addressing meetings of his countrymen he was in doubt whether the whole of
those whom he was addressing were discontented. He thought he need not have any
particular doubt about the audience at that meeting. He hoped there was not a
person on that ground who for one reason or another not discontented with the
life he or she lived. They were connected with a great struggle. Into the
details of this strike he would not enter. He quite understood that they were
at present in such a position that they could scarcely live at all. Their
struggle was for a position in which they would be able to live a life which
people called tolerable. (Hear, hear.) He  did not call the life of a working
man, as things went, a tolerable life at all. When they had gained all that was
possible under the present system, they still would not have the life that
human beings ought to have. (Cheers.) That was flat. What their life at the
best? They worked hard day in, day out, without any sort of hope whatever.
Their work was to work to live, in order that they might live to work. (Hear,
hear, and "Shame.") That was not the life of men. That was the life of
machines. That was the way in which capitalists regarded them. They ware simply
not regarded. except as part of the machinery of labour. He could show them
book after book, speech after speech, in which in point of fact they were so
treated. And they wore told, whatever they did, to be careful to regard
themselves in that light. They were looked upon as a class from which the utmost
and best that could be expected was that some of them—and this was frequently
said—would have the luck to get out of the position of workers, to be thrifty,
to save money, and become—what? Legalised thieves—that was the word. That was
the reward that was offered to them for the very utmost virtue that they could
employ. They were looked upon as a class who, if they took care, and only
worked hard enough, might have the pleasure and profit of becoming thieves, and
leaving that position and profit to their children after them. (Laughter and
cheers.) Why was it that they were condemned to live in that toiling hell in
which they lived? If the present labour system were to continua no theologian
or parson need trouble himself to invent another hell.  That would be perfectly
good enough for all purposes. (Hear, hear, and laughter.) Why were they
condemned to live in hell? They worked to live, in order that they might live
to work. That was the meaning, the reason, the be-all and end-all of their
lives. Even supposing he did not understand that there was a definite reason in
economics, and that the whole system could be changed, he should still stand
there in sympathy with the men present who were trying to better their
position, if it were ever so little. If the thing could not be altered at all,
he for one would be a rebel against it. (Cheers.) That was his point of view,
and he celled upon them in so many words to rebel against this system. There
was no other word for it. Rebel they must, or. if they did not, they had lived
slaves so far, they would die slaves, and their children after them would be
slaves. They had no right to be slaves. (Cheers.) He understood perfectly well
the necessity for that strike, and for many other strikes which had preceded
it. Let them remember one thing. if the present system remained as it was,
after they had gained that strike there would presently have to be another
strike. They surely did not suppose that their masters, if the men had beaten
them, were going to sit down contented with their beating. Certainly not, and
he would tell them why—because the masters' actual position was that they held
the whole of society with an iron hand. They were the masters of society.
Unless the men rebelled against them, the masters of all society they would
remain, and strike after strike would follow. Now they would win, then they
would lose; but let them remember that all the time they would be at war. War
was the condition of their lives as against their masters (Cheers.) War was the
condition of the masters' lives. both as against the men and against every one
of their own class also. What he preached to them was what the Socialists
always had to preach. Not war—peace. Peace was to be the outcome of all that
they struggled for now. When he asked them to persevere in their strike, and do
the best under the present system, it was because he well understood that it
was a part of the great labour struggle throughout the whole world. He could
not look upon it as a mere isolated event. It was part of the labour struggle
which was forced upon them whether they would or not. Their business, from the
very hour—from the very minute—was to make the union of the workers no longer
in any sense exclusive, but altogether inclusive. Workers over the world must
combine. He had told them to rebel. Let them understand clearly that there were
plenty of ways of rebelling which offered very little risk to the immediate
ruin of the whole of society. And it was worth while thinking about that,
because, unless they took one of these means, the rebellion would come in a
blind, unguided, unorganised manner, and would destroy the whole of our present
society. Their rebellion should be conducted in such a way. that it would be a
kind of insurance against the violent deaths of the members of the upper
classes. Take, for example, one thing they could do. They had got a strike.
Suppose that strike included the whole of the miners in the British Islands.
Would not that have rather a different effect from their present strike?
Suppose it included not only the whole of the miners, but the whole of the
wage-earners in the British Islands. Why not? When they were in that position,
let them remember what they were. Why, they were the useful part of the
community in the British Islands. Who would resist them then? Their rebellion
would soon end in victory in that case. The mere knowledge that they were
combined, the mere fact of putting their fingers in their waistcoat pockets for
a weak, would decidedly bring about a great crisis. (Cheers.) He believed that
that crisis would take the form, after they had made those claims which they
would have to make, of the entire, complete , and immediate submission of their
masters.  Their masters would come to them and they would say, "We can't be
your masters any more since you won't have us, but you actually should give us
some compensation. The compensation that you owe us is to teach us to work as
you work. We must have that, because at present we have learnt no other trade
than that of spunging on other people. (Laughter and cheers) Teach us an honest
trade and we shall be well contented for our troubles.  He admitted there was
another thing they might do.  If there was such a thing as a general strike, he
thought it was possible that the masters of society would attack them
violently—be meant with hot shot, cold steel, and the rest of it. But let them
remember that they (the men) were many and the masters were few. It was not
that the masters could attack them by themselves:. It was only the masters with
a certain instrument, and what was that instrument? A part of the working clams
themselves. Even these men that went in blue with bright buttons upon them and
white gloves—(Voices : "Out with them")—and those other men dressed in red, and
also sometimes with gloves on their fingers, what were they? Simply working
men. very hard up, driven into a corner and compelled to put on the livery of a
set of masters. (Hear, hear, and prolonged hooting.) When they were able to say
that those false rights of property were no rights at all, but the wrongs of
humanity, what would happen?  When those instruments, the soldiers, and police,
and sailors, came against them and saw that they were in and saw that they were
many—they all knew the sufferings of the workers—what would happen? They would
not dare obey their masters. The cannon would be turned round, the butts of the
muskets would go up, and the swords and bayonets would be sheathed, and them
men would say, "Give us work; let us all be honest men Like yourselves". If the
men once made up their minds to understand their position, and understand that
they ought to be the organisers of their own labour and the masters of their
own destiny they would gain a victory and nothing short of it, and a true
victory. Not a little more wages hers and leave to work six days instead of
four. He wished they only worked two days and got the same wages or more. Six
days a week for the work they had to do was a great deal too much for men of
ordinary body and strength. What, he asked, was a life of real happiness? Work
for everybody who would work. For him who would not work they could not say
that society had rejected him: he had rejected society. The masters had
rejected society. He wished that the all men might have a life of refinement
and education and all these things which made what some people called a
gentleman, but what he celled a man.  (Cheers.) That was the victory he wished
them. Nothing short of that would be victory. And yet every skirmish an the
road, and every attack on the position of the masters brought them nearer. They
must go until all the workers of the world were united in goodwill and peace
upon earth. (Loud cheers)</p>

<p>The resolution was carried unanimously, with three cheers for the strike.</p>

<h3>SPEECH BY MR. HYNDMAN.</h3>

<p>Mr. H. M. Hyndman proposed the following resolution:</p>

<p><em>that, seeing the helplessness of getting the just reward of labour under the
present system of competition, monopoly, and wage slavery, we pledge
ourselves to organise for a free labour system, in which the land, capital,
and all industrial resources shall be owned by the community, and used in
co-operation for the good of all.</em></p>

<p>He said he came there that day instead of an engagement that he entered into a
few days ago, but did not know until Saturday morning that be would be able to
come. But his place on the Socialist platform in Hyde Park had been taken by a
friend of his, whose name would be received, be thought with cheers by every
man in that assembly. His place in Hyde Park, to protest against the infamous
Coercion Bill in Ireland, had been taken by his friend, Michael Davitt.
(Cheers.) And he asked them there, as Englishmen, to give three cheers for
Michael Davitt, the Fenian, who was now standing and proposing justice to the
country in Hyde Park. (Cheers.) No honester man ever stood forth on behalf of
the working class of any country than he; he could wish no better thing of the
men of Northumberland than that out of their own rank, might come a Michael
Davitt for the miners of the North of England. They wanted it badly. (A voice:
"Badly.") Aye, they did; and he hoped that one result of that great meeting
would be that, out from the ranks of the men around that platform would come
some man, fired with the injustice done to bis class, fired with a hope of the
future that lay before the working men, fired with a hope of the future that
lay before the working men, fired with a sense of what he could do with his
strong hands and his strong voice, that he would come forward ready, as Davitt
bad been, to face imprisonment and death itself, for the cause of the people
from whom he sprang. Being these, he had to propose the resolution which he had
read. And, talking of coercing, were they not coerced at that moment? (Cheers.)
What worse coercion could there be than economical coercion? It was all very
well to talk about food and labour, but a man who was striking for wages knew
right well that the worst of all coercion was used by the capitalist class—the
coercion of crying women and starving children, the coercion that was used
against strong men, who bad not the food wherewith to nourish themselves,
although ready to labour for the benefit of the community. This they saw going
on daily. The moment the working men of England attempted in any way to support
their rights, then they heard of coercion here in England, as they heard of
coercion in Ireland six years ago, and as they heard of coercion in Ireland
today. Their chairman had told them that their friend John Williams was now in
gaol. They did not hear of parsons or lawyers being put in gaol for supporting
the rights of their class—not at all. But John Williams was a man of the
people—he was standing up for the rights of the workers in London, as he did
here, and therefore they took an opportunity to provoke a riot, and clapped him
into gaol without bail ("Shame.") Aye, and it would come to them; if the miners
were to stand by their man in an organised determination, then they would clap
their leaders under lock and key, too. (Cheers.) Many years ago, a friend of
his, a German, was working in one of the large cabinet manufactories in London,
and around him there were a number of Englishmen, who would never submit to
coercion or to have free speech shut up—or they said so. At that time,
Bismarck, over in Germany, had passed what was called the "Muzzle Law," whereby
Socialists in Germany could not speak at a public meeting, or could not have
free speech in any shape or way. Well, these Englishmen, when they read or this
law, turned to his German friend, and said, "Look here, you Germans cannot say
what you want to say, if you begin to talk in public, why, they put you in
gaol. They would not dare try that here; if they were to try to suppress free
speech here, we would soon show them that it was no use here." The German stood
this for a good long time. and at last turned round to his English comrades and
said, "Vell, I neavere did hear any time as any man vas such a fool as to
muzzle sheep." (Laughter.) There was no need to muzzle them—not yet, But let
them wait until they changed their shape into something a little name
formidable, and they would precious soon clap the muzzle on them. They were out
on strike there. The great men who owned the country said to them, "If you
don't choose to work at the price we ask, why, we will shut the pits." Why not
say they would shovel them out of the country altogether? (A voice: "They might
as well") He agreed with his friend in the crowd. They could not be much worse
off than they were. This was what was going on, not only in their coal
industry, but in every industry. When the workers in South Staffordshire and
East Worcestershire bad been beaten, the South Wales miners thought they would
strike, and when the South Wales miners bad bean beaten, then the Scotch miners
set to work; and when they were beaten and obliged to go in at a reduction,
then the wise Newcastle men thought their turn had come. (Laughter.) Thus they
perceived that the capitalist beat every one in detail, and he traded upon the
differences of the working men throughout England. They should not merely come
to meetings, but should combine in their factories and in their mines. For the
fight in which they were engaged the killed and wounded were all on the side of
the workers; it was a fight in which they perpetually lost, because they were
taken in detail, because they were beaten first in one place and then in
another, because they did not enter upon that great combination of which his
friend William Morris had spoken, and which that resolution would pledge them
to if they passed it.  They were told that, as a matter of fact, trade was bad,
and that this was the reason the masters could not do better for them. In the
year 1874, there were 530,829 persons producing 140 millions of tons of coal;
but in the year 1884, 514,000 persons produced 163 millions of tons of coal, an
increase of over 23 millions of tons. That was to say, in 1874, the miners won
261 tons of coal per head; and in 1884 nearly 350 tons of coal per head; but
although they were getting more wealth from underground, they were getting less
in wages in return for the wealth they produced. (A voice: "True.") Aye, it was
true; and he had come there not merely to make them dismounted—be trusted they
were discontented already—but to point out to them that something more than
discontent was needed, that, as their resolution said, the present system of
competition was ruin to the working men, a system which forced every man to
live upon a mere wage—this it was which drove them into their present
condition. Here in England, where there was more wealth in proportion to the
population than in any other country in the civilised world—why was it that the
workers were in this hopeless state? Why was it that they there were driven to
strike against a reduction of the miserable wages that they had? They had not
employment, end yet without their coal there was not a single industry in
England could go on. (Cheers.) The coal mines ran the whole of the railways,
they ran the whole of the factories, they kept the blast furnaces of the whole
of this great empire going, and they, themselves, the bed rock of prosperity,
so to say, were turned out on the street starving.  (Cheers.) Their condition
would he hopeless so long they were contented to be as they were. He had had it
said to him, "Nothing can be done; what would you do?" Why, there were enough
men there to change the whole system of Northumberland and Durham. He saw
enough men and women around that platform to teach every man, woman, and child
in Northumberland and Durham before this year was out, that the future of the
people would be theirs, and not that of the capitalist and the landlord.
(Cheers.) If every man were imbued with the true principles of Socialism, if
every man were ready to make the same sacrifice that little John Williams had
made in the name of the people, if every man there were willing to work for
this as some men had worked for such things as temperance in the past, within a
year the Socialist party would be the strongest party in England. He asked them
to do this. What had they to look forward to otherwise? In every country in the
world competition was growing. They themselves were sending from Newcastle and
from their other manufacturing towns, the very machines that would be needed to
compete against their labour. Their neutral markets were being invaded even by
coal which was won by the machines they sent out. The condition of the workers
was getting worse in every great industrial centre. They had got to look
forward only to the continual increase of the present pressure, to continued
gain for the capitalists and lower wages for the working men, to a condition of
society for their children worse than that which they contended with
themselves. In this country, 225,000 families owned between two-thirds end
three-quarters of the total wealth of the country.  ("Shame.") Aye, shame on
them, all the lot of them, for not having the pluck to upset the system, for
not teaching one another, for letting their petty jealousies stand in the way
of their cause; shame on them, that skilled and unskilled, agricultural
labourer and artisan, pitman and sailor, did not combine to overthrow this
crushing system, that meant degradation, misery, and ruin to every man.  woman.
and child of the working class.  Shame on them, he said; they should combine,
unite, stand together, be at one in the struggle of the people against the
plunderers. They provided the wealth; for whom? For those who despised them,
for those who said they had not got pluck to rise. He had heard them say it in
their drawing rooms, that they did not believe the people had got the power to
act in this matter. He asked them what they could expect from the House of
Commons? Fifty years or more had gone by since William Cobbett said, "You
should not say, 'The House of Commons are a den of thieves,' that is bad
grammar; you should say, The House of Commons is a den of thieves,' that is
good grammar and sound sense" (Laughter and cheers) There they were, landlords
and capitalists, capitalists end landlords ; Tory, Whig, Liberal, and Radical.
alligators, sharks. (Laughter.) Aye, but it was so. It was no laughing matter.
These men were their enemies.  And what they came there to ask them to do was
to take this assembly into their own hands, to form in their industrial
centres, to form in every one of their mining villages, to form in every one of
their great cities centres where they could unite, in order to bring a change.
He appealed to the working men of Northumberland and Durham to take up this
cause; it was their own. They who belonged to the upper or middle deem, who
came to speak to them, knew right well that the violent, the great change that
was coming, must come to, and from, and by the people. They asked them to
consider this—that it was today for the capitalist, by the capitalist, with the
landlord as his partner; but the future was for the people. This was no Utopia,
it was the practical result of present misery. They asked the people to
emancipate themselves, for they could do it. (Loud cheers.)</p>

<p>Mr. A.  K. Donald seconded the resolution,  and said they should insist upon
having the whole produce of their labour. They meet not be content with a
paltry twopenny or sixpenny, or even half-a-crown increase. They must insist
that everything they earned should be their own, that they, and their wives and
families, would be able to live honestly on the proceeds of their labour. They
should insist also that those who were too lazy, too idle, too stupid to work,
should have meted out to them the same thing that they had meted out to the
people, and had meted out to their forefathers before them. They had allowed
them to die on the sheets,  and on the highway, and permitted them to go to
some decidedly ugly den they celled Workhouses, there to die a pauper's death.
He said they must insist upon those that will not work dying in that position.
(Cheers) He appealed to them to organise for the purpose of bringing about a
better state of things. The resolution was carried with one dissentient.</p>

<h3>THE COERCION BILL</h3>

<p>Mr. J. L. MAHON moved:</p>

<p><em>that we strongly condemn the coercion measure now before Parliament and pledge our
sympathy and active help to the Irish la any steps they think fit to take to rid
their country of the curses of landlordism and alien Government.</em></p>

<p>—The Irish people, he said.
had been coerced too long. If the law said that men were not to combine to get
their rights, that they were not to organise to secure their own freedom;
if the law said that the working men dared not open their mouths; then he
said, "Damn the Law" (Cheers.) The Government had no right to pass that
law, and no right to enforce it. If another Coercion Act were passed, he trusted
that they would see the Irish people on the hillsides in open rebellion
against the power which had done that. (Cheers.)</p>

<p>Mr Hyndman seconded the resolution. He was happy to remember that six years
ago the organisation to which he
belonged was the only English organisation that stood forward against Liberal
coercion. (Cheers.) And he was glad to feel that standing there that day he
could as vigorously protest against Tory coercion. (Cheers.) He himself,
though an Englishman, was a member of the Central Executive of the Irish Land
League of Great Britain. Englishmen ought to have recognised sooner that
the Irish were fighting their cause in relation to the land. There are two
thousand Landlords in Ireland who had the blood right of crushing out the
existence of the Irish tenant farmers, and were the brothers and the allies of
the landlords who crushed those whom he was addressing. The landlords here
supported the landlords there, in order that the royalties which they squeezed
out of the miners might be supported by the landlords of Ireland in turn.
(Hear, hear.) More went in royalties to-day to the landlord than went in
wages to the men. Therefore for their own sakes, if not for the sakes of the
Irish, let them stand altogether against the infamous, Star Chamber, bloody
bill, that these infernal Tories had brought into the House of Commons.
(Cheers.) Let them stand against the oppression, if not for the sake of the
Irish, for the sake of themselves. (Loud cheers.)</p>

<p>The resolution was carried unanimously.</p>

<h3>MINES REGULATION.</h3>

<p>Mr. JAMES SMITH, Millington, moved that this meeting protests
against the clauses to the new Mines Regulation Bill with relation to the
employment of women and girls above ground.</p>

<p>Mr. SADLER seconded. Referring to the
strike, he said that, unless they could get free and simple arbitration in
Northumberland, they would not go to work without it. (Cheers.) The resolution
was unanimously carried.</p>

<p>The meeting then concluded, with cheers for the
social revolution.</p>

<h2>MEETING AT RYTON.</h2>

<p>A meeting was held in the evening, at
Ryton Willows, Mr. J. L. Mahon presiding. Mr. William Morris addressed the
meeting on the general subject of Socialism. He said, to his mind, people in
general ought to be thoroughly happy. The foundation of that happiness was
that we, as human animate, must, in the first place, be healthy human animals.
Without this we could not be happy, moral, religious, or anything else but
miserable. In point of fact, unless we were healthy human animals, we were the
very worst things the universe had to show—spoilt men. The reason they were
Socialists was because they saw there was a great deal of this spoiling of men
and women, and this they wished to remedy. That was the root and foundation of
all human unhappiness when we did not fulfil our natural and reasonable
functions as human animals. Man must eat at least once in twenty-four hours.
The obvious deduction from this fact was that man, when he tried to form any
kind of society, would have done his best to make it easy for him to acquire
the necessary meal, or necessary series of meals, in 24 hours. If we found it
difficult to get a livelihood we must, in point of fact, be unhappy and spoilt.
Granted that society was absolutely necessary for all men, they would also
have to consider that man had certain rights. The first right a man had when he
came into the world was that that should live. If this right ware to be
combatted, there would be nothing but perpetual war between every individual
or race, and they could easily conceive, if that were the case, man would not
have made any progress from the first moment he became a distinct man and
different from other animals. They might take it for granted that society,
properly considered, meant the extinction of the clashing rights of one man
with another. That these clashing rights should be merged into the general
rights of the whole race was the germ of true society—the respect of each
other's rights. If this had always been acted upon, there would never have
been any occasion for revolution or agitation of any kind. in point of fact
society would have existed as one great harmonious whole, in which everyone
felt that helping his neighbour was the only way in which he could best help
himself. This was the ideal of society which Socialism laid before them. He
asked them to turn from the ideal society and consider the ordinary life of
men in this country, which was acknowledged to be the most successful country
the world had seen in the production of wealth. A country wherein there were
the most resources and materials for satisfying the needs of every man ought
certainly to be a country in which people's needs should be satisfied. Yet he
could point to countries that had not a thousandth part of the resources of
this rich country wherein the people were far happier than those who lived in
England. He said distinctly by far the greater portion of the population of
England were concerned simply in considering bow they were to get the next
day's dinner. This was what our boast of humanity and superiority had come to.
True society, in which all had equal rights. had, unfortunately, been usurped
by a false society, which had brought about all those terrible evils which be
had scarcely dared to picture to himself. We were in this condition in
consequence of a series of events too long to think about, by which we had
been driven into a state of perpetual war with one another—a war of individual
against individual, and class against class. One class bad arrogated to itself
a kind of superiority over other people of the same race as themselves, and
instead of a society under which every man bad equal rights and equal
opportunities, we had a false and artificial society—a society which was
comprised distinctly and decidedly of classes. The difference between the two
great classes was that the members of one did not work, but lived on the other
class, the members of which did work. The class which lived upon the other
class was a class which was of no true use to the world. Whereas, the class
which was lived upon was that which was useful. In other words, there was a
class which made everything that was necessary to be made, and did everything
which was to be dons in the world, and there was another class which by some
extraordinary freak of fortune had got into a position of living on the labour
of the first class, without doing any useful work themselves. Now, he wished
them to consider most seriously whether or not such a condition of the human
race could be altered. It seemed to him not to be a difficult matter to alter
it at this stage of the human race, when we had clearly got it into our heads
that we were in such a position. And, as thoughtful people, they should see
that an alteration was made in some form or other. This was really the whole
point that they, as Socialists, wished to lay before them—in the first place,
that society meant the good of every one of its members—leaving none out;
that it was possible to realise this intention of society; and only possible by
people looking it in the face and trying themselves to realise it. Under the
present condition of society, one class got all the halfpence and the other
all the kicks, and if his hearers thought this was just they were not fit to
be citizens of a great country. He urged them to study all the books and papers
they could get hold of that dealt with the Social question, which was the
greatest of all important questions. When they had done this, they could only
come to one of two conclusions : that they belonged either to the upper class
or the lower class—as the working people were stupidly called—and take action
accordingly. There might be a third course. Someone might find something or
another which was superior to Socialism, which the Socialists would embrace
with enthusiasm and say, "This is the thing we have wanted so long." The
people of the present day had a very great position to attend to, and he urged
them to give that attention to it which it deserved. It was, he said, a matter
which lay with the intelligence of the human race, and particularly with the
intelligence of the working classes, with the intelligence of those who made
all the useful things that were made, without whom the world could not exist,
but which could stare the existence of everybody else. It was their business to
see that the whole world became one great society in which people would work
to their own advantage, and not for the advantage of other people. {Applause.)</p>
